            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wherefore if wee woulde, that GOD ſhoulde gouerne vs by his holy ſpirite, (to the ende to make vs inioy and poſſeſſe his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all &amp; heauenly good things, which he gyueth not but vnto his children alone, the members of Ieſus Chriſte his ſonne) and by conſequent, if wee woulde be ſaued and made bleſſed, wee ought to hold and keepe our ſelues, firme, ſure, and well ſtayed in the Churche, ſo that there

            <p>There are ſome others, who remaine aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as it were, and doubtfull, not knowing to which parte to turne, neither on which ſide to ſet themſelues in order, ſeeing the Romiſhe Church armed with great force and authority, mainteined and vpholden by great perſonages, clothed with diuers orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, outward appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and folowed of the greateſt number: On the otherſide, beholding the reformed Church feeble and weake in outward ſhewe, made and ſtanding for the moſt parte, of the ſmaleſt and baſeſt according to the worlde, ſimple in dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges and ceremonies, and folowed of verie fewe people.</p>
            <p>But the doctrine of the trueth (which is our principall light, and chiefe guide) giueth vs a good remedie and aide in this difficultie, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vs that the true Church, ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the falſe, by her own right and true markes. which are the pure preaching of the

            <p>You (my Lorde) haue ſometimes ſeene what trouble &amp; combats the very viſard, bare name, &amp; ſhining ſhew, of the Romiſh Church hath brought, to ſome mens conſciences and ſpirites, and that not onely amongeſt the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and ignorant ſort, but euen in the rancke and order of thoſe, which made profeſſion and tooke vppon them to teache others: yea ſo far it hath carried them, that by reaſon there was not in them a full reſoluteneſſe, they knew not of what companie they ſhoulde bee.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding as touching your ſelfe after that God had honoured you with his knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and called you into his Churche, that you mighte bee comprehended within the ſheepefolde of Ieſus Chriſte his ſonne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing almoſt made open profesſion of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and caſt away the beaſtes marke, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhaking and ſtaggering you perceiued in diuers others, you notwithſtanding haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued, through Gods grace, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſetling your ſelfe vpon his aſſured and inuincible worde. And in deede, by

what force and ſtrength coulde the backe ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of ſome, and the Sophiſticall diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other ſome, aſtoniſhe your faith, or beate downe your conſtancie, ſo well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined and vpholden by the holy Ghoſte? How coulde theſe aſſaultes cracke your courage, or change and make colde your zeale, ſo hotte in the ſeruice of God?

            <p>But the queſtion is nowe, to continue in well doing, and to proceed dayly from good to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For this is nothing to beginne wel, except a man perſeuere and continue euen to the end. And wee knowe what Ieſus Chriſte ſaith, to wit, That hee which putteth his hande to the plough, and looketh backe, is not apt to the kingdome of God.<note place="margin">Luke. 9.62. <hi>2.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.5.</hi>

            <p>There are ſome which ſay, that this is enough, for a man to haue ſome teſtimonie in his conſcience, that hee belongeth to God,

albeit hee make not, any declaration or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his religion. But by the teſtimonies heere aboue marked, and put downe, it is eaſie for vs to gather what neede wee haue, to range and bring our ſelues into the true Churche, that wee may therein liue Chriſtianlie in the ſeruice of God, ſeeing that any where els there is neither life nor light. And alſo what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can they haue of their ſaluation, whiche liue in this world as dogs and ſwine, folowing the traine and ſteppes of Sardanapalus, or of Epicurus, to eate and drinke, to laugh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, to play and to giue themſelues to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without thinking any whit at all of God, or remembring any religion? Wherefore my Lorde, euen as you haue well and bleſſedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, hauing had right knowledge to diſcern, betweene the true and falſe Churche: ſo it yet reſteth, that you perſeuer and continue, yea that yet you proceede and paſſe ſome what further, to range and bring into order all your houſe in the feare of God, that it may be vnto him a holy and chaſte Churche: in the middeſt whereof hee may take pleaſure to dwell, that thereby hee may bleſſe you, and make you to proſper.</p>

            <p>But if the holy Scripture did not teach vs this, yet wee might in ſome ſorte learne it out of prophane authours, that is to ſaye, Philoſophers and Heathen lawe makers. For among the Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. in Politicis.</note> Ariſtotle in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litikes hath ſaide: That godlineſſe and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are the matters which Magiſtrates ought

to eſteeme moſt neceſſary, for the eſtabliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of common weales.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Plato in Epi. nom.</note>And Plato in his Epinomis ſaith alſo: That Princes ſhoulde not at any time bee perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there is any thinge more profitable and neceſſarie for mankinde, then that vertue is, which men call pietie and godlineſſe, that is to ſay, religion and the ſeruice of God.</p>
            <p>And as concerning lawe makers, wee knowe, that they hauing to prouide, for neceſſary things, and to make ordinances and decrees therefore, haue alwaies giuen the firſt &amp; moſt honourable place, to pietie, or godlineſſe, and the ſeruice of God. And in deede becauſe they woulde that their Lawes ſhould bee of greater authoritie, and better receiued of their people, as well agreeing with pietie and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they haue made them beleeue that their Gods were authours thereof.<note place="margin">Minos.</note> Minos the Lawemaker of the Cretenſes, gaue them to vnderſtande, that hee was Iupiters familiar friende, and that hee ſpake often to him, to the ende the people might beleeue that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from him the lawes which hee eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed amongeſt them.<note place="margin">Zoroaſtes.</note> Zoroaſtes, gyuing lawes to the Bactrians and Perſians, ſaide that hee receaued them from Oromaſon, whome

            <p>Wherefore this remaineth reſolute, and ſtandeth ſure: that Princes and Magiſtrates, to the end, that they may in good policie and order gouerne their Lordſhips, and frame the maners of their ſubiects, ought alwayes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnne with pietie and the ſeruice of God, as with the moſt neceſſary matter, and as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which there is no regiment or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in the world, which can long ſubſiſt or ſtand.</p>
            <p>And therefore for this cauſe ſpecially is it, that
<pb facs="tcp:25134:10"/>
good kinges, princes, and lordes are praiſed in the ſcripture, as Dauid, Ioſiah, Hezekiah, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt kinges: Ioſeph and Daniell, amongſt the rulers and gouernours of prouinces for kings: Moſes, Iehoſhua, &amp; the iudges amongſt thoſe, who had the guiding and leading of people which were free.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the flatterers of the courte doe uilanouſly abuſe and mocke the very Lordes and Princes, when they blowe this into their eares, that the cauſe of religion concerneth them nothing at all, and that they ought to be content with this that they haue ſome care of politike matters committed vnto them, and charge of their domeſticall and houſholde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and namely of their Horſes, Dogges, Haukes, Foules. &amp;c, forwarre, for hunting, hauking, and for their other particuler plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, without trauelling and taking any more paine, for all that, or any part thereof, which concerneth the good eſtate and affaires of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>Thankes bee to GOD (my Lorde) that you be far otherwiſe inſtructed in that which belongeth to the duetie of Chriſtian lords and magiſtrates, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the courtiers brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prate, not to ſuffer your ſelfe to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,
<pb facs="tcp:25134:10"/>
neither to goe aſtray from that, which the trueth hath once taught you. And I hope, yea, I hope it very ſtedfaſtly, that that great God who hath put and placed in you ſo good ſeed, will giue it ſo good an increaſe, that hee will be thereby for euer glorified, and that that true, and not counterfeite profeſſion of the religion which you haue, wil bring to paſſe that you ſhalbe more and more loued &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of good and honeſt people, and feared and reuerenced of the wicked and perſecutors.</p>
            <p>On mine owne parte, that I might bring ſome aide and ſuccour to the faithfull people, to the end that they might learn by your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to put a difference betweene the true and falſe Church, and by the ſame meane to reſolue to keepe and ſtay them ſelues vppon the true Church: and that I might alſo giue ſome fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and plaine order to all, to knowe on which ſide the true Churche is, I haue as diligently builded, framed and prepared this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as it was poſſible for me, wherein I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of the Churche, and all the pointes and partes thereof, that I thought meete and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to touch, or could thinke vpon.

<pb facs="tcp:25134:11"/>
the matters, therein declaring all that, which wee ought to behold and beleeue of the Church, touching her eſtate, forme, guiding, and gouernment. For I ſhewe therein, what is the true Churche: which are her true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible markes, which is the true ſucceſſion and calling of Paſtours therein, what is her ſpreading abrode, increaſe and continuance, who is the head thereof: howe ſhee is holy: whether ſhee may erre: what is her power and authoritie: amongeſt whom it is: what be the degrees and orders of her guiders: what is her diſcipline: whether the miniſterie be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her: And laſtly I ſpeake, of her perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and afflictions, in which point I am ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more large then in the reſt, becauſe I knewe that the preſent need and occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, to the ende I might confirme and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithful peoples co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences at this time, in which it ſeemeth that the Diuell, the enimie of Gods glorie and our ſaluation, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chayned and vntyed, and that all the worlde is kindled with rage and ſet on fire with furie, and conſpired with him furiouſly to ruſh vpon the poore Churche, ſetting out and making a ſhewe againſt it, of all that that crueltie can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. Weerefore I ſhewe what is the ſtate
<pb facs="tcp:25134:11"/>
and condition of the Church on earth, &amp; that ſhee hath alwaies had, ſuch a vertue of patience and ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie and courage in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the croſſe that tyrants haue rather left of to perſecute her, then that ſhee hath failed and fallen away by their torments: inſomuch that ſhe hath abode inuincible and vnconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, againſt the vehemencie and violence, of ſo many horrible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bats, as ſhe was to ſuſtain &amp; indure, and out of all them hath brought a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victorie, and moſte glorious crowne.

            <p>As touching the fruite and profite whiche may come of this little labor, I dare not affirme any thing thereof, except it bee in reſpect of you my Lorde, For I doubt not but you take as muche pleaſure to heare mee diſcourſe in writing vpon this matter of the church, as you commonly doe, when you heare mee ſpeake, either particulerly to your ſelfe, or publikelie in the execution of my charge and office. And yet if you regarde that which is mine, without doubt the fruite wil bee none: but if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

the argument, and the large laying out of the matters conteined in this preſent treatie, I aſſure my ſelfe, that it will not bee altogether vnprofitable, and that they which ſhall reade the ſame, will not repent themſelues thereof.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I ſtaying my ſelfe (my Lord) vpon your accuſtomed goodneſſe, through which you diſdaine not, or diſlike any thing, which commeth from your ſeruants, offer and dedicate vnto you this little booke, moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeching you to accept it, and to take it well that it commeth out into light, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſcription of your name, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with ſuch gentleneſſe and curteſie, as you haue been accuſtomed to loue vertue, and fauour Chriſtian religion, and thoſe that make profeſſion thereof. For I hope that (if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and take it well, that your name ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it more grace and liking, and ſhall get it more authoritie, and purchaſe it more fauour, amongeſt all, becauſe that thinges dedicated to great perſonages, are better receiued of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſort, although the thinges of them ſelues are oftentimes very baſe and of ſmall account and value.

faithfull Miniſters in binding, loſing, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or miniſtring the Sacraments: yet that this equalitie in miniſtration doth nothing hinder a diuerſitie, diſtinction of degrees, and ſuperioritie in gouernment, being very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the auoiding of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion and ſchiſme. That this preheminence is not lately deuiſed or newe begunne, may ſoone appeare by theſe words of the Apoſtle. The ſpirites of the Prophetes are ſubiect to the Prophetes.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I gather, that if the ſpirites of all the Prophetes, being lightened by the vertue of the holy Ghoſte, were not free from the checke of other Prophetes, vpon whom it had pleaſed God to beſtowe his gifts of iudgement, knowledge, and learning: much more ought wee to allowe and preferre the graue and learned iudgement of the beſt, and graunt them a dignitie &amp; preheminence in matters of leſſe importance. The reaſon by the Apoſtle is not to be neglected. <hi>Non eſt Deus author confuſionis, ſed pacis,</hi> as who ſhoulde ſay: if ſome were not appointed to decide ſuch doubtes as ariſe either of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or of mallice, all woulde goe to wracke in haſte, and Chriſtian education to mortall hatred.

Seth, Enos, Sem, ruled the Church in their time, &amp; the Church acknowledged &amp; obeyed their gouernment. The beſt writers affirme that the firſt borne had the rule of the whole familie. Noah alone ruled in making and ordering the Arke, in which there were cleane and vncleane beaſtes, tame and ſauage of all kindes, to ſignifie the church gathered together of both Iewes &amp; Gentiles, and gouerned by Ieſus Chriſt only, as by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Noah. The Church vnder the lawe had diuerſitie of orders as may appeare in ſundry places. In the third of Numbers, where the Tribes are muſtered, the three families of the Gerſonites, Kohathites, Merarites, had their Prince or head which they called Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha. In the firſt of Kings, &amp; the 4. Azaria is called the Prince of the Leuites. Obadiah that worthie Counceller, meeting with olde Heli, diſdaineth not to call him lord.

S. Iames ſaith: Be not yee many maſters. And Chryſoſtom ſaith, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of dignitie and place bringeth forth ſchiſme.

Patriarches which ſhoulde be in order and dignitie aboue Archb. it was for the preſeruation of diſcipline. Wherefore it is apparant by teſtimonies of holie ſcripture, by light of reaſon, and by practiſe of the Church, by the neceſſitie of the thing that diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of degrees &amp; ſuperioritie is neceſſarie in the church, as without the which, law would ſoone grow to libertie, faith wold ſoone be deuided, &amp; the coat of chriſt Ieſu, which is his church, rent and torne in ſunder, ſo many fancies, ſo many faithes would follow.</p>

For a man can not otherwiſe rightly declare, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vertue, and diſpoſition of any thing, vnleſſe he be firſt reſolued of the ſenſe and meaning, in which it ought to be taken. For as much therfore, as this word, <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:25134:18"/>
is of that ſort (being a Greeke word, which ſignifieth an aſſemblie or congregation, &amp; is taken or deriued from a word which in that tongue ſignifieth to call, or to cauſe to come) it is meete and neceſſarie, that before we giue the definition thereof, we declare after howe many ſortes men vſe to take it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Nowe men ſometimes take it, for a companie or aſſemblie of wicked perſons, as Pſalme 22.16.<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.16.</note>

               <p>Firſt it is called triumphant, or elſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant. The Church triumphant, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of bleſſed ſpirites, who hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten victorie through Ieſus Chriſt, againſt their enimies the diuell, the world, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, ſinne, death, and hell, triumph at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, on high in heauen, praiſing God, and celebrating the glorie of his name, with all ioyfulneſſe. We haue a goodly deſcription of the Church in the Reuelation.<note place="margin">Reu. 7.9.10.</note> Cap. 7.9.10.</p>
               <p>The Church militant, is the aſſemblie of all the faithful people, who as yet on earth fight, vnder the banner or ſtandard of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt their head, againſt the foreſaide enimies, whoſe armours or weapons are ſet out by S. Paule in the Epheſians.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.13.14. &amp;c.</note> chap. 6. For it is not the Lords will, that ſo long as we are to walke here belowe, we ſhould be without afflictions, but he will haue vs to be continually in the battell, and alwayes troubled and tormented through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25134:19"/>
of men, yea ſo much the more, by how much we ſhall earneſtly indeuour to ſerue him in all godlineſſe and holineſſe,<note place="margin">Act. 14.22.</note> this matter alſo being alreadie concluded, that by many tribulations we muſt enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of God. Wherevnto do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alſo,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.20.16.2. 2. Tim. 3.12.</note> the ſentences of Ieſus Chriſt and S. Paul. Ioh. 15.20. Ioh. 16.2. 2. Tim. 3.12. But hereafter we will ſpeake more largely of the afflictions of the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diſtinction is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church is called either Catholike, that is to ſay, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall or generall, being diſperſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the world, and comprehending vniuerſally, all the faithfull and elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: or elſe particular, which is a part of the vniuerſall: for we vſe to call them particular Churches or congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are limited within a certaine number, and incloſed in certaine places, being, as it is ſaid before, partes and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the vniuerſall: ſuch in former time were the Churches of Corinthus, Rome, Epheſus: &amp; ſuch are at this day, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Fraunce, Germanie, England, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, and other places, of all which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conſiſteth the vniuerſal, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is but one, as anon we ſhal ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:25134:20"/>The third diſtinction is: that the Church is ſometimes ſaid to be inuiſible, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſible. The inuiſible Church is ſtreitly and narrowly conſidered, and is the verie ſame, which before we called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or vniuerſall, comprehending only the faithfull and elect, in which number they alſo are to be accounted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be already dead.</p>
               <p>The viſible Church is conſidered more largely, and comprehendeth al them which are called by the preaching of the Goſpel, to be of Chriſtes flocke.<note place="margin">Auguſt in Pſal. 64.</note> S. Auguſtine vſeth this diſtinction in his writings. For writing vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 64. Pſalm, he ſaith: <hi>that the Church, which is ſignified by Ieruſalem, tooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from Abell, and Babylon from Caine:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, in his booke of Baptiſme, againſt the Donatiſtes, chap. 16.<note place="margin">Auguſt. li. 1. cont.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25134:20"/>
as to other, which I ſaide was viſible. But firſt of the Catholike and inuiſible Church.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y that which hath bene ſaid before, it is an eaſie matter to gather and make a good and certaine definition of the Church.

With this definition agreeth that, which may be gathered out of that which Saint Paule ſaith to the Corinthians, to wit, <hi>that the Churche is the companie of all thoſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>This Church is called Catholike or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall for three reaſons.

                  <note place="margin">Math. 28.18.</note> 
                  <hi>are by the Father appoynted to his ſonne, for his inheritaunce:</hi> and therefore alſo did Ieſus Chriſte ſende foorth his diſciples through out all the worlde to preache the Goſpell and to miniſter the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.

                  <note place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> when he went about to tie the Church to a certain corner of Affrica onely.

(wherof we wil ſpeak in a whole &amp; plaine chapter afterwards) yet it could not be but a particular Church, &amp; at no hand the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal church, wherof we ſpeak.

               <p>Secondlie, it is called Catholike, in conſideration of the perſons, for it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and containeth al the faithful, of what eſtate, ſex, or condition ſoeuer they be, as S. Paul ſheweth, when he ſaith, <hi>That there is neither Iewe nor Greeke,</hi>

               <p>Furthermore we hold <hi>that this Church is one, euen as it is ſayde,</hi>

For amongeſt all thoſe, which truely beleue in Chriſt, there is one bodie and one ſpirite, one hope, one Lorde, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and father of all, which is aboue all, and in all, and through all: and therevppon it is, that Saint Paul ſaith of the whole church,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.4.5.

the Church is but one. Wherevpon Saint Cyprian ſaide: <hi>There is no more but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, which is ſpreade abroade or ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out farre and wide, as there are manie beames in the Sunne,</hi>

               <p>We ſay alſo that this church is inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that there is none but God alone who knoweth the ſame: &amp; therefore Ieſus Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.14.</note>

                  <hi>No no ſaith the Lorde vnto him, I haue reſerued vnto my ſelfe ſeauen thouſande men which haue not bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> But let vs marke that wee ſpeake of the bodye of the church generally, and not of the members thereof particularly. For there is no doubt, but that wee may by ſignes and outwarde teſtimonies, profitably iudge of election, euen as men iudge the tree by the good fruite, and yet this muſt be vnderſtoode ſingularly and ſpecially when the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerneth our ſelues.

                  <hi>but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they would haue continued with vs.</hi> We haue an example hereof in Iudas, as Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe witneſſeth the ſame in Saint Ioh. Here then we haue to marke this,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.70.13.18.</note> that the outward profeſſion of Chriſtan religion, is not ſufficient to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore this Church is knowen by her own proper marks, which are two, verie principall and ſubſtantiall. The firſt is the pure preaching of the worde, with a right and common conſent thereto. There was neuer yet any religion, which was not vpholden, maintained and pointed out by ſome doctrin. So we ſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gentiles, haue had their ſeruices, hymnes, ſonges, &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto their Gods: The Iewes haue the barke or huſke of the lawe, and their own Thalmude: The Turkes haue the Alcoran of their Mahumet, and the heretikes alſo boaſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the doctrin of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and yet all theſe are falſe ſignes or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25134:25"/>
markes. But the true church hath for her firſt and principall marke, the worde of God purely preached, to the which the church conſenteth, &amp; conformeth hir ſelfe, as we proue it plainely by theſe places of ſcripture.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.27.</note> Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce, and I knowe them and they followe mee.</hi> And Saint Paule in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Epheſians:<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>you are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophetes, Ieſus Christe himſelfe being the cheife corner ſtone.</hi> And indeede if this be true (as of neceſſitie it muſt needes be) that by the Scriptures wee are brought to the knowledge of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth:<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.39.</note>

               <p>This matter the auncient fathers reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, when they taught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the true Church ought to ſhewe and declare it ſelfe, by the holy ſcriptures, as Saint Auguſtine, ſaying: <hi>There is great diſputation betweene vs and the Donatistes,</hi>

in the wordes of our Lord Ieſus Christe, the head thereof? verily we ought rather to ſeeke for it in the wordes of him that is trueth, and knoweth very well his owne body. For the Lord knoweth them that be his.</hi> And againe:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19. Cont. Pitili. cap. 3. Aug. epiſt. 166.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not ſhew or declare the Church by the doctrine of men, but by the word of God. Alſo by the ſcriptures</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we haue learned Christ; by the ſcriptures likewiſe we haue learned to knowe the Church. We haue theſe ſcriptures common amongeſt vs, wherefore then doe we not retaine and holde in them, both Chriſt and his Church?</hi> And Chryſoſtome ſaith:<note place="margin">Supr Matth. expoſit. 2.

                  <hi>He that will knowe which is the true Church of Chriſt, by what meane can he knowe it, in ſuch and ſo great a confuſion of outward ſhewe, if it be not onely by the ſcriptures?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The other marke of the Church is the lawfull adminiſtration of ſacraments.<note place="margin">Cont.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25134:26"/>
and ſacrifices. The Iewes had Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and ſome other outward ſignes of their religion. But the true Church hath, for the ſecond of her markes, her owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſte the head thereof, that is to ſay, baptiſme, and the holie ſupper. And therevnto muſt be referred that which Saint Auguſtine ſaith: <hi>The Lorde hath vnited or knit together the newe people (that is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad inquiſit. Ianuar. ca. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the people vnder the newe Testament) by the ſacraments, which are few in number, eaſie in obſeruation, and very great in ſignification: to wit, by baptiſme, conſecrated or administred in the name of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and by the communicating or partaking of his body and of his bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, Saint Paule doth in like ſort rightly teach vs this, when he ſaith, firſt of baptiſme,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.13</note> 
                  <hi>that we are all baptiſed by one ſpirit into one body:</hi> and afterward of the ſupper: <hi>we that are many,</hi>

But it ſhall behoue vs to holde and to keepe in memorie one foundation or ſure ground, to wit, that theſe two markes muſt alwayes be retained and kept in their puritie, without being any manner of way falſified or corrupted: that is to ſay, that the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine muſt be pure, and the adminiſtration of the ſacramentes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25134:27"/>
ſound and lawfull. For indeede in outward ſhew they would make men beleeue, that theſe two markes are to be found amongſt the Romiſh Catholikes, but when all ſhall be rightly and duely examined, we ſhall finde that the true Church, is not for all that on their ſide.</p>
               <p>For as concerning the worde, it is not preached by them rightly or purely, but (as S. Hilarie ſaith) <hi>they make a ſenſe vpon the ſcriptures, and take it not out of the ſcripture, and make it as were a leaden rule, which men commonly call</hi> Regula Lesbia, <hi>applying it to their owne intentes and purpoſes, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their owne purpoſes to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this matter, it is needfull for vs to knowe, that all expoſition of holy ſcripture, muſt be referred to two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal heads or ends, that is to ſay, that it tend to the glorie of God, and that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable or agreable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> analogie &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith. For touching the firſt, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.18.</note> 
                  <hi>He that ſeeketh the glorie of God, is true.</hi> Now without doubt, when the Romiſh Catholikes extol mans free wil, &amp; aſcribe vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome merit for his works, they ſnatch, &amp; as it were by violence, pull away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſome part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25134:27"/>
is due vnto him: and ſo by conſequent, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſerue them ſelues with certain peeces of the ſcriptures, to proue that which they pretend, they can not therein excuſe them ſelues, but that they corrupt and falſifie the ſcriptures, declaring them ſelues hereby right heretikes indeede.<note place="margin">In epiſt. ad Galat.</note> For (as S. Ierome ſaith) <hi>Who ſo euer expoundeth the ſcripture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the ſenſe &amp; meaning of the holy Ghoſt requireth, although he haue not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne or ſeparated him ſelf from the Church, he ceaſeth not for all that to be an heretike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly S. Paul declareth, <hi>that he,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>who hath the gift of prophecie, ought to prophecie</hi> (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay) <hi>expound the ſcriptures according to the proportion of faith.</hi> Now if in this behalfe, we would take heed to, and marke the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which the Romiſh Catholikes make and bring foorth vpon the ſcripture, we ſhall finde at the leaſt, for the greateſt part, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they alledge or bring nothing leſſe, than the right &amp; true ſenſe therof, not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> analogie &amp; proportion which is required, &amp; namely, when the queſtion is, to expound theſe wordes of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my body.</hi>

               <p>As much alſo may we iuſtly ſay in that behalfe of many other articles which they haue corrupted,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.9.</note> beſides y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very often they propound &amp; teach for doctrine mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which are not only not drawne or taken from the word of God, but which is more, are altogether contrarie therto: as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning abſtinence from meats, forbidding of marriage, inuocation of Saints, praier for the dead, adoration or worſhipping of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and images, &amp; many other ſuch like matters. And as concerning the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, it is certaine, that they are not lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by thoſe men, neither yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme and ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, but they adde and ioyne to them in the miniſtration thereof infinite abuſes, &amp;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25134:28"/>
ſuperſtitions, &amp; do corrupt them, through a certaine kinde of idolatrie, which is dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and full of vngodlineſſe, for (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may ſpeak nothing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiue ſacraments which they haue added of their owne) let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in what puritie, baptiſme and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſupper is adminiſtred amongeſt them.</p>
               <p>Firſt is this a ſmal abuſe, to applie or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter baptiſme to things without ſenſe (as to bells) which was not ordained but for reaſonable creatures? Is this a ſleight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning therof, to ioyne to this ſacrament, oyle, ſpittle, ſalt, and other ſuch things, as though it did not behoue vs to be content with that ſimplicitie, wherein and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Ieſus Chriſt hath commaunded his Apoſtles to adminiſter the ſame?</p>
               <p>And touching the holie ſupper, when they cauſe men to worſhip a morſell of breade for Ieſus Chriſt: when they denie to the people the ſigne of wine: when the Prieſt eateth all by him ſelfe, ſo that there is not any communion or partaking at all, what is a corruption of the ſacrament, and an ouerthrowing of the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, if this be not?</p>

that ſeeing it muſt needs be, that the word of God ſhould be purely preached and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the ſacraments lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, to the end that men may holde &amp; take them, for right and certaine markes of the true Church, &amp; that we are certaine, and it manifeſtly appeareth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie be found amongeſt the Romiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, it followeth verie well, that theſe are not to be attributed to them, although they would make men beleeue, that theſe markes doe agree vnto them, and their Church, as well as vnto vs. But we wil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute more largely in an other chapter of this matter, to witte, whether the Romiſh Church be the true Church or no?</p>

               <p>BVT it may be that ſome wil demaund: Is not the ſucceſſion and ordinarie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Paſtours, a marke alſo of the true Church, yea, one of the principall markes?

I ſuppoſe that it is not ſuch a ſucceſſion, as is from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſonne, as it hath beene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the line and race of Aaron, as to ſay that he ſhould be a prieſt, that is the ſonne of a preiſt, for ſo they might ouermuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouer and vnfold the vilanie of their high prieſtes: but that they meane a continuall ſucceſſion of Biſhops and Paſtors ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one an other, euen from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles.

               <p>But that we may not ſpeak confuſedly of this point, we muſt diſtinguiſh, betwene the ſucceſſion of perſons, or that which is of the chaire and place, and betweene the ſucceſſion of doctrine and office.</p>
               <p>As concerning the ſucceſſion of doctrin, we ſay, that it is altogether on our ſide, &amp; no whit at all, on the Romiſhe Catholikes ſide, for we make profeſſion to teach, the pure worde of God alone, following ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prophetes and Apoſtles, whereas they of the Romiſh Church, ſtaying them ſelues vpon their inuentions, teach for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.9.</note> the traditions and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of men, which thing Ieſus Chriſt expreſly forbiddeth.</p>

Apoſt. can. 58.</note> excommunicateth the Biſhoppes and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who haue not anie care either of their cleargie, or of the people, the charge of whome is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them, and which doe not teach them in the doctrine of true religion: which canon alſo ordeineth, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25134:31"/>
if ſuch continue in their negligence and careleſneſſe, they ſhoulde be depoſed.</p>
               <p>There reſteth the ſucceſſion of perſons or that which is of the Church or place: touching which, firſt we ſay, that the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctours did not alwayes aide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with this argument when they were to fight with heretikes: for hauing to deale with ſuch, as did receiue and allowe the worde of God, as well as themſelues, the diſpute and matter in controuerſie betwen them being onely in the true interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, they contented themſelues to alledge ſcripture, expounding places one by an other, euen as Saint Auguſtine ſaith: <hi>That that which is darke in one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
                  <hi>is cleare and manifest in an other.</hi> But when they were to reaſon againſt them, that would add to the holy ſcriptures, as Manichaeus, who woulde, that men ſhoulde receiue his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, which hee called fundamentable, euen as it were the Goſpell it ſelfe, there and in that reſpect, they ſerued their turne with the argument of ſucceſſion. And yet when they vſed it, it was not either their onely or their principall defence. For in the firſt place they ſhewed by the worde of God, that they were in error, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25134:31"/>
added as a good bulwark or meane of reſiſtaunce, the conſent of the Church witneſſed by a continuall ſucceſſion of all ages and times. Alſo, they helped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therewith as with a verie likely or probable argument, and good inough in the defence of trueth againſt errour, but yet not ſo, as though it had a like force and ſtrength, for the maintenance of error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt trueth it ſelfe. Laſtly, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of heretikes, from whence they came, from whome they deſcended, who were their predeceſſours &amp;c. they meant not to ſpeake of their vocation or calling, which they neuer called into doubte or queſtion (for the greateſt number of them were Biſhoppes, as Neſtorius was Biſhop of Conſtantinople, Samoſatenus of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche, all lawfully called, and hauing right and authoritie to teach in the Church) but they meant to ſpeak of their doctrine, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was newe, and not hearde of before. Wherfore when they alledged, or layd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them ſelues, they did not ſo much meane the occupying of the chaire, or enioying of the place, as the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conformitie and agreement of the doctrine: whereas on the otherſide, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25134:32"/>
do not demaund of vs, who were the authours of our doctrine, but inquire of vs touching our vocation and calling, and are contented with this to declare, that their Biſhoppes, are deſcended from al an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, but not their doctrine: and yet notwithſtanding they deceiue them ſelues. For neither in the primitiue Church, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long time after ſuch Biſhoppes, as be nowe in the popedome, had any place, ſo that a man may ſafely ſay, they are not deſcended from the Apoſtles, nor from the true ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we ſay that it is verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ſuch a ſucceſſion of the paſtors in the primitiue Church, was of greate weighte and importance, becauſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors at that time, had not onely the name and title of paſtors, but did withall fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſe the Charge and office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But what is at this day the dutie of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and prieſts of the Church of Rome? Let the moſt ſounde iudge thereof. Is the controuerſie in the Church, touching ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to ſome inheritaunce, to haue the poſſeſſion and enioying thereof? No, but rather, for men to ſet their hands to worke and labour, as the Apoſtles haue done, to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25134:32"/>
watch diligently ouer Chriſtes flocke, and to miniſter vnto it, the foode which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and meete for it. As S. Paul ſaith: <hi>If any man deſire the office of a Biſhop,</hi>

               <p>And in the firſt Councel of Paris,<note place="margin">Concil. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſi. Can. 8.</note> is was decreed, that no biſhoppe be ordeined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of the Citizens of the citie, but onely hee which ſhall bee choſen by

               <p>Nowe after right examination, &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full election or choiſe (which are two very eſſentiall points and commanded by gods lawe, with which none in the world may diſpenſe) there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in the third place, the impoſition or laying on of hands, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is a ceremonie, by which the miniſters that were lawfully choſen, were offered &amp; dedicated as it were to the ſeruice of God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25134:38"/>
and the Church.</p>
               <p>But let vs nowe examine, the Romiſh prieſtes vocations firſt I aske, whether the election which is made amongſt them, be deferred, and put ouer to the poſtours and the Churche, yea or no? Euerie man ſeeth what place and authoritie they giue, to their reſignations, as they call them, to their permutations, collations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, donations &amp;c. and alſo howe the Magiſtrates and greate men, giue Biſhopprickes, Abbotſhippes, perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vicarages, and other benefites as it pleaſeth them ſelues. If the paſtours, or to ſpeak more rightly, they that vſurpe the place of true paſtours indede, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the election, then it appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Pope alone, to chooſe the Cardinalles, the Biſhoppes, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppes, and to giue the greateſt and the fatteſt benefices: And it belongeth to the Biſhoppes, to chooſe the ſimple or fingle prieſtes, and to beſtowe or giue the other inferiour and leſſe benefices. And where is then the holy conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongeſt the Paſtours, which is of neceſſitie required in the election?</p>
               <p>Secondarilie, is the people called to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25134:39"/>
it? or is the people aduertiſed or forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to bring thither and giue their aduiſe and conſent thereto? Euerie one knoweth that this is not performed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as concerning them whome they chooſe, what ſerious or earneſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, make they, either of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or of their doctrine? Sometimes they choſe infantes and children, at no hande fit or meet to exerciſe, the leaſt charge of the Church whatſouer it be. Sometimes they choſe men altogether ignorant and verie often alſo of wicked life, &amp; this they doe through fauour, mony, robberies, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, factions and other lewde and naughtie practiſes, ouerthrowing all order, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting all good pollicie and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding, the Canons which they attribute to the Apoſtles, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne and determine,<note place="margin">Can. Apoſt. Can. 29. &amp; 30.</note> that euerie biſhop, Elder or Deacon, that ſhall haue obteined his office, by monie or giftes, or by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the princes and potentates of this worlde, ſhoulde not onely be depoſed, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their eſtates and offices, but alſo excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and caſt out of the Church, and that not onely they themſelues, but alſo they which ſhal admit and receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:25134:39"/>
into ſuch charges, and which ſhall ſhewe them fauour, and ſhall communicate with them. Nowe let men marke, howe theſe Canons are at this day obſerued and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the Romiſh Church, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, howe right and lawfull the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, of the Biſhoppes and prieſtes of that Church. It is true that they vſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the impoſition or laying on of hands, but euerie one knoweth with howe many trifling toyes and ſupperſtitions it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied. And indeede, this is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poynt, whereof they can vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which is not ſo neceſſarie, but that we may verie wel ouerpaſſe or litle regard it, as hauing no expreſſe commaundement touching the vſe thereof. For touching the two ſubſtantiall pointes, they wante them wholy,<note place="margin">Titus. 2.7.</note> contrarie to the ordinaunce of Saint Paul. Titus 2.7.</p>
               <p>But touching our vocation, it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter for euerie one to iudge, whether it be true and lawefull, euen by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding which they that choſe vs, keepe &amp; hold, in the right examination &amp; diligent inquirie that they make, as well of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſufficiencie, meane and manner, of teaching, as of our life, manners and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25134:40"/>
alſo by the allowance and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt conſent of the people, who do receiue vs, after that they haue a certayne ſpace hearde and tryed vs. For wee holde and teach, that none ought of himſelfe, to teach and haue charge in the Church, vnleſſe he be lawfully called therevnto. It apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to the Lorde of the harueſt,<note place="margin">Matt. 9.38.</note> to ſend foorth workemen into his harueſt.</p>
               <p>And S. Paul touching this matter asketh, <hi>Howe ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> And therefore in the Prophet Ieremiah, they are taxed and reproued as falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,<note place="margin">Iere. 14.14.23.21.</note> which did runne not being ſent. And Ieſus Chriſt ſaith alſo:<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>That they which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not in by the dore into the ſheepefolde, but climb vp ſome other way, are theeues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhappes the Romiſh Catholikes, will not ſo much examine our calling, as that of the firſte reformers and reſtorers of our Churches, and will demaunde of vs, from whome it is, that they receiued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of handes: and finding in their owne indgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as they ſuppoſe, that they had not any certaine vocation, therevpon they woulde inferre, that then they could not chuſe &amp; cal vs to our charges, &amp; ſo by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25134:40"/>
conſequent our vocation ſhoulde be none at all, wherevnto we anſwere two things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is: that we ought to exerciſe our calling, according to the viſible ſtate of the Church, which is either altogether, or elſe abiding ſafe and ſound. If then the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church abide in her puritie whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is then, when pure doctrine is kepte therein, and the lawfull adminiſtration of ſacramentes, with the right vſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, we ſay, that an ordinarie calling, that is to ſay, the way and manner of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing paſtors, preſcribed by the worde of God, according to which we haue beene called &amp; placed in our charg, ought to be obſerued &amp; followed. But if the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, be altogether corrupted, we ſay, that then an extraordinarie vocation hath place, euen accoding as it ſhall pleaſe God to raiſe vp his ſeruauntes, and to employe them, to reforme the Church, and to bring it to her olde puritie. For God is alwayes not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ordinarie meanes, which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth notwithſtanding, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n it ſeemeth ſo good vnto himſelf. And this was practiſed in former time, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ten tribes of Iſrael, were altogether become baſtards and corrupted, through their idolatries.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25134:41"/>
For God did extraordinarily ſtirre vp,<note place="margin">1. King. 18.19.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Elijah, to reforme them, and to indeuor to bring them into good order touching his ſeruice: yea I ſay Elijah, who was not a prieſt, and had not in that reſpect any ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe we holde and affirme, that God hath dealt in our time, in the choiſe and ſending of ſome of our miniſters, who were inſpired and ſtirred vp by GOD, to ſtreatch out the hande vnto the Church, which in reſpect of the outwarde and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate, was wholy almoſt beaten downe and ouerthrowen. And theſe men neither could nor ought to looke, to be ſent from, or to be approued by the pope &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe intollerable abuſes and falſe doctrines, they had in charge to reproue no more, then they that woulde take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to reforme a companie of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had openly fallen, to whordom, fornication &amp;c. ought to wait, to be ſtirred vp or required therevnto, either by alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or ſome of them, they pleaſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and being deſirous to continue in their former diſſolution and leudnes.</p>
               <p>Here to alledge, that for the making of and extraordinarie vocation certaine and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25134:41"/>
approued, ſome miracles are neceſſarie, or elſe ſome certaine, plaine, and manifeſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſcripture, is to no purpoſe at all, or they ſay as much, as if they ſaide nothing. For as concerning places of ſcripture, we are not deſtitute thereof. Ieſus Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Goſpell to the Prieſtes, who did not well and rightly execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in their charges, demaundeth of them, <hi>When the Lord of the vineyard ſhal come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 21.40.41.</note> 
                  <hi>what will he doe to theſe wicked huſbandmen?</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome they aunſwere, condemning them ſelues: <hi>He will cruelly destroy theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and will let out his vineyard vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther huſbandmen, which ſhall deliuer him the fruites in their ſeaſons.</hi> Now this was indeed iuſtly and faithfully accompliſhed. For the Lorde tooke away his vineyard, that is to ſay, the gouernement of his Church from the Prieſtes, Scribes, and Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who did not yeld him the fruits which did belong vnto him, and committed the ſame vnto other husbandmen, that is, to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, which haue yelded him fruites in their ſeaſons. And euen in like manner hath the Lorde done in the Popedome, beholding euill workmen in his vineyard, that is to ſay,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25134:42"/>
wicked &amp; naughtie Paſtors in his Church, which did not at any hand their duetie and office, he hath not deſtroyed his Church, but hath chaunged the ſtate and condition thereof, taking away her blind guides, and giuing vnto her others which ſee clearely.</p>
               <p>It is alſo written in the Apocalipſe: <hi>The holy citie ſhall they tread vnder foote two and fortie monethes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 11.2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>but I will giue power vnto my two witneſſes, and they ſhall prophecie a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, two hundred, and threeſcore dayes.</hi> In which place S. Iohn foretelleth, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption of the Church, which ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt times, yet ſo that withall he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that God will not ſuffer his ſeruice to continue ſo corrupted and baſtardly, but that he wil reforme it, and bring it to her former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſoundneſſe, and that for this purpoſe he will raiſe and ſtirre vp witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his owne, to prophecie and ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo greeuous a corruption. And howe ſhall this be done? by vſing an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 9.49.</note>We may alſo verie well applie to this purpoſe, the example of him, who caſt out diuels in the name of Ieſus Chriſt. For the Apoſtles would haue hindred him, bicauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25134:42"/>
he did not followe Ieſus Chriſt as they did. But Ieſus Chriſte ſaith vnto them: <hi>Take heede that ye forbid him not, or hinder him for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he that is not againſt vs, is with vs.</hi> It is verie true indeede, that ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie vocation, ought not to be lightly approued, but it is alſo as true, that it ought not as lightly be condemned.</p>
               <p>But we haue a certaine and manifeſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, of this extraordinarie vocation in Phillip.<note place="margin">Act. 6.5. &amp; 8.5.</note> For he being onely ordained a Deacon at Ieruſalem, was afterwardes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily called by God to preach Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Beſide, the firſt reſtorers of the Church of our age or time, who were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily called, are not to be reproued or bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for raſhneſſe. For as in a citie beſieged by the enimie, or aſſaulted with fire, when they which were ordinarily called for the ſafegarde &amp; defence thereof, and to giue order in the daunger of fire, ſhould be them ſelues the firſt enimies and putters to of fire, if it fall out that certaine citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, hauing other charges or offices in the citie, or elſe if they were but priuate and particular perſons, would come and ſet vp them ſelues, and imploy them ſelues, in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25134:43"/>
running to the breach and fire, to the end that they might preſerue the citie, ſo farre off is it, that they deſerue or ought to be reprehended, as traitors and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſons, that on the other ſide, for a fact ſo courteous &amp; gentle, yea ſo profitable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrie, they were greatly to be praiſed, as verie good citizens, and true friendes &amp; preſeruers of the countrie: ſo when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſaueguardes or keepers of Gods owne houſe, haue declared them ſelues to be enimies thereof, and putters too of fire, to ouerthrowe and marre all, they that are afterwardes aduaunced and ſet forwardes them ſelues to reſiſt them, and to maintain the right and eſtate of the ſaide houſe, yea although they haue had no manner of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie vocation, but in their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, haue onely felt them ſelues extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily called, for to execute ſuch an office or charge, ſo farre off is it, that either they may or ought to be blamed, that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they deſerue honour &amp; great praiſe.</p>
               <p>And yet this is here to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit al are not enioyned or commanded to preach, as wel as all are commanded to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or ſet them ſelues againſt falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet by conſequent it followeth verie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25134:43"/>
wel, that if any do aduaunce or ſet forward them ſelues, to oppoſe or ſet them ſelues againſt falſe prophets, they haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt their vocation or calling.</p>
               <p>Add alſo, that euen thoſe which in the beginning were extraordinarily called, hauing faithfully acquitted and behaued them ſelues in their charges, in preaching the truth, and being receiued and allowed of the people, that vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs, which before was extraordinarie, hath ceaſed, yea muſt ceaſe, and afterwards is become ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</p>
               <p>And as concerning miracles, we will ſhortly aunſwere thereto. Let the Romiſh Catholikes ſhewe, what miracles Iſaiah, Amos, Obadiah, Nahum, Zechariah, and many other Prophets did, whom God did extraordinarily ſtirre vp, where they which had the order and gouernement in their owne handes, abuſed the ſame. Next, let them conſider,<note place="margin">Matt. 12.39.</note> that it appertaineth to an euil &amp; adulterous generation, to demaund &amp; ſeeke ſignes, as Ieſus Chriſt ſaith. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that miracles may ſeduce and deceiue. For we read, that falſe prophets, ſeducers,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.1. &amp;c. Matt. 24.24.</note> and deceiuers, haue ſometimes done them, thereby to deceiue men, and to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25134:44"/>
their falſe doctrines,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.9.</note> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthen their ſuperſtitions and idolatries. And therefore we ought not by miracles to iudge of the vocation and doctrine, but rather on the other ſide, by the vocation and doctrine we ought to iudge of miracles and ſignes.</p>
               <p>The other thing which we aunſwere, touching the vocation and calling of our firſt miniſters, is, that we may verie well ſtop the mouthes of the Romiſhe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, if we would alledge, that thoſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters them ſelues for the moſt part, had in reſpect of them ſelues an ordinarie voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being indeede called in their time, by the Pope, and by him eſtabliſhed and ſet in their charges, and therefore by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent had authoritie and right, to goe vp into the pulpit, and to teach in the Church, as Luther, Zwinglius, Oecolampadius, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and before them Wicklef and Iohn Hus. Alſo that in England, Sweden, and Denmarke, the right and lawfull ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chaire or place, is on our ſide. For there the ordinarie Biſhops haue receiued the Goſpell, and preach it, ſo that we ſhall not neede to diſpute of their vocation, no more then for the calling of the Prieſtes,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25134:44"/>
which are at this preſent in the Romiſh Church, called by the Pope, but euen only of their doctrine.</p>

               <p>WE muſt not thinke, that the Churche had her beginning, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles began to preach the goſpel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world, at which time the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, were firſt named Chriſtians in Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, but that ſhe began to be in the world, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the verie time of our firſt parents Adam and Heuah. For in them and by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God began to be ſerued on the earth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bleſſed them, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſeruice, and after their fall hauing prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them repentance and aſſurance of victorie againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſerpent, through Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world increaſing, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church alſo was augmented, ſeruing God. For as S. Paul ſaith: <hi>God created the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.26.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; hath made of one bloud al men, that they might ſeeke and ſerue him.</hi> And he himſelfe ſaith in Iſaiah: <hi>This people haue I formed for my ſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 43.21.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhall rehearſe and ſhewe foorth my praiſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:25134:45"/>
GOD then created in the worlde, and that from the beginning a Church, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough free adoption, to this ende, that his name might be duely praiſed, by conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, fit, and meet witneſſes for ſo excellent a worke. For this cauſe alſo the Church is called the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.<note place="margin">Iſai. 61.3.</note> Iſaiah 61.3.</p>
               <p>Moreouer this Church, notwithſtanding the ſharpe and hard perſecutions which it hath ſuffred, hath not yet ceaſed alwayes to be, as it is at this preſent, and ſhal be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worldes end. For as Dauid ſaith: <hi>The Lord hath choſen Sion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 132.13. &amp;c.</note> (that is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church) <hi>and hath deſired it for his ſeat: it hath bene</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my rest for euer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 28.20.</note> Ieſus Chriſt alſo hath promiſed his diſciples, to be with them alwayes, euen vnto the end of the world. But chiefly Saint Paul hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſet out the perpetuitie and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Church, when he aſſureth vs,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>that GOD ſhall be glorified in the Church through Ieſus Christ, throughout all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for euer and euer.</hi> They then are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much paſt ſhame, which limit the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Church to a certaine time, as thoſe of whome Saint Auguſtine ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">Auguſt. de ciuitat. Dei. lib. 18. ca. 54</note> who durſt boldly affirme, that the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:25134:45"/>
chriſtian religion ſhould not laſt, but 365. yeares. They likewiſe doe abuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues, which thinke that by the aſſaults which they giue vnto the Church, they are able to beate it downe, conſume it, &amp; wholy take it away out of the world. for is it poſſible that God ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Church?<note place="margin">Pſal. 100.1. &amp;c.</note> hath not he himſelfe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that his ſonne ſhall raigne and beare rule for euer ouer all his enimies? Verily the Church which is the ſpouſe or wife of Chriſt, is become or made ſo mightie and ſtronge through her husbande, that being euen one bodie with him, ſhe is more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and mightie in her weakeneſſe, then al the world in his pride and hautines. But as we haue alreadie ſaide once heretofore, we will hereafter ſpeake more amplie and largely of the Churches force and power in perſecutions. To bee ſhort: amongeſt ſo manie and ſo diuerſe chaunges, of the kingdomes of this worlde, God alwayes preſerueth his Church, and bringeth to paſſe, that nothing in al the world is dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perpetuall, but ſhe, not that ſhe is alwayes floriſhing, or hath a continuance, which followeth al by one threede, that is, commeth altogether, but becauſe that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25134:46"/>
God, not minding that his name ſhoulde be put out in the worlde, doeth alwayes in his Church raiſe vp ſome, of whome he is ſincerely and purely ſerued.</p>
               <p>Nowe when the queſtion is, to diſcerne the true Church from the falſe, ſome there are that ſtay themſelues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multitude and great number. But they are very farre from their right reckoning or account. For GOD meaſureth not his Church by the number.<note place="margin">Matt. 18.20.</note> He loueth his faithful people, &amp; keepeth himſelfe in the middeſt of them, although they be a verie ſmall number. on the otherſide, he hateth thoſe that doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it, and diſdayneth them, though the number of them be neuer ſo great. And indeede, on the ſide of the multitude and great number, the falſe and baſtardly Church is rather founde, than the true and lawfull one. And that it is ſo, let vs firſt marke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places of ſcripture, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe vs from the multitude, and teache vs to ſtay and cleaue to the little flocke.</p>

               <p>On which ſide was the Church, when the chiefe Prieſtes and ſcribes,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.3.</note> and Elders of the people, aſſembled themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the Hall of the high Prieſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Caiaphas, and helde a Councel, how they might take Ieſus Chriſt by ſubtiltie, and put him to death?</p>
               <p>Certainly by theſe examples, it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued, that if it were ſufficient to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the multitude &amp; the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for to vnderproppe and vpholde a Church, the falſe and baſtardly Church, ſhoulde euer preuaile in the matter, &amp; get the better in that reſpecte, becauſe that the number which cleaueth to it, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and maintayneth it, is alwayes the

Sometimes it was in Abel alone, who was ſlaine by his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked brother Cain. Sometime it was in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch alone, who was reiected of the vngodlie. Sometimes it was in the onely houſe of Noah, and he bare with or ſuffered all them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the floude, and the Arke ſwimming vpon the floudes, was ſaued, and ſet vpon the drie land. Sometime in one onely Abraham, of whome we knowe thus much, that he ſuffered manie thinges by the wicked. Sometimes in Lott alone, and in his onely houſe, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Sodomites, whoſe iniquities and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe he indured and ſuffered ſo long, till God drewe him as it were by violence from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Sometimes in the onely Iſraelites tormented by Pharaoh, and the Egyptians.</hi> By theſe wordes that appeareth verie well, to be true and right which I haue ſaid, to wit, that the Church ought not to bee iudged or acknowledged by the great number.</p>
               <p>The faithfull then ſhoulde not at this day bee offended, though they bee but a ſmall number, deſpiſed and caſt out as the filth and ofſcouring of the worlde, for becauſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25134:48"/>
they are not of the worlde,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.19.</note> but that God hath choſen and drawen them out of the worlde, therefore beholde doth the world hate them. They ſhoulde not doubte that the Church is not with them, though that it be aſſaulted and perſecuted of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of men, and thoſe the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, of greateſt reputation and higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and namely of the popes, Cardinals, Biſhoppes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27.28.29.</note> pariſhe Prieſtes, Abbots and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the cleargie of Rome, who indeede ought to maintaine and vpholde it. For ſo it is, that GOD hath choſen the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thinges of this world, to confound the wiſe things; &amp; the weake or feeble things, to confounde the ſtrong; and the vile and deſpiſed thinges, and thoſe thinges which are not, to bring to naught things that are, to the ende that no fleſhe ſhoulde reioyce in his preſence.<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.22 Matt. 21.42. 1.

               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:25134:48"/>But ſome will ſay, wherefore then is it, that God hath heretofore ſuffered, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people in ſo many ages and times, to bee ſeduced and deceiued? Yea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doeth he at this day ſuffer, the greater parte of the worlde to walke in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of errour and ignorance? Verily it is not our part, to take vppon vs either to diſcouer or curiouſlie to ſearch the ſecrete cauſes of Gods eternal iudgement, neither yet to laye or caſt vppon him the faulte of our naughtineſſe and vngodlines, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that hee doeth moſte iuſtly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and guide all thinges, and therefore cannot doe iniurie or wronge to any man, what ſo euer he doe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.

                  <hi>GOD</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in times paſſed hath ſuffered all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to walke in their owne wayes: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee lefte not him ſelfe without witneſſe, in that hee did good &amp;c.</hi> And agayne,

                  <hi>The time of this ignorance God regarded not, but nowe he admoniſheth all men euery where to repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding alſo we may rightly ſay, that God ſuffereth Sathan to haue ſo much power and might in the worlde, as that he ſhoulde beare ſway &amp; raigne ouer the greater parte, to the end that he might thereby, through his iuſt iudgement, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe men for their vnthankefulneſſe and vnfaithfulneſſe. For it is not good reaſon that thoſe which would not hearken vnto God, neither receiue the truth which was offered them, and who alſo euen willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of their owne accord, haue deſpiſed and refuſed their owne ſaluation, is it not meet I ſay, that ſuch ſhoulde be ſeduced &amp; deceiued through the ſubtilties and ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the diuell, and at the laſt caſt from God, and through his iuſt iudgement pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, according as their vngodlineſſe &amp; vnthankefulneſſe deſerueth? Saint Paul writing vnto the Theſſalonians, ſheweth and putteth downe this reaſon, when hee ſaith:<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.10</note> 
                  <hi>That becauſe that they which periſhe receiued not the loue of the trueth, that they might be ſaued, God ſhall ſende them ſtronge deluſion, that they ſhoulde beleeue lies, that all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25134:49"/>
they might be damned which beleeued not the trueth of the word, but had pleaſure in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This alſo fell ſometimes, and was laide vpon the Gentiles. For from the beginning of the world,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20. &amp;c.</note> GOD made manifeſt vnto them his Godhead and his power, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this was not done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of men, yet it was by the miniſterie of the creatures, in which his glorie was in ſuch ſorte manifeſted and ſhewed, that a man may wel ſay, they had in ſome ſenſe, a ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, as it were to ſhewe, ſet foorth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the great power and the wonderfull workes of God. But what thereof? Theſe ſtraglers &amp; ſtrayers hauing knowne God, did not glorifie him as GOD, neither yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him thankes, but became vaine in their imaginations and diſcourſes, and ſo foorth, as Saint Paule ſheweth of them in the firſt Chapter to the Romanes. Who will then at this day ſay, that GOD hath done them wrong, when he giueth them ouer to the luſtes of their owne heartes, to filthineſſe, and their owne villanous affections through a ſpirite deſtitute and vnfurniſhed of all iudgement, to commit things at no hand conuenient or ſeemely,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25134:50"/>
he puniſhing them after this manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, and his owne moſt iuſt righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame fell alſo in time heretofore vpon the poore and miſerable Iewes. For beholde our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who of his owne free will, preſented and offered him ſelfe vnto them, being willing and readie to inſtruct and teach them, in the doctrine of ſaluation, confirming his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by excellent miracles and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſignes worthie of credite, by which he did euidently ſhewe vnto them, that he was the verie Meſſias promiſed in the lawe, and the true and onely redeemer of the worlde, but howe did theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people gouerne and behaue them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in that behalfe? Their obſtinacie and rebellion was ſo great, that they were not onely content, deſperatly to reiect, and throwe from them, the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Goſpell, ſlaundering it and accuſing it of falſehood, but which is worſe, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and cruelly murdered the onely ſonne of GOD, and outragiouſly perſecuted the Apoſtles (as before that they had put to death alſo euen their owne Prophets) and other Chriſtians. Who is he then which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:25134:50"/>
will affirme, that theſe wicked people did not through their rebellion and pride iuſtly deſerue to be deliuered and giuen ouer for a pray vnto Sathan, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued through the ſubtilties and craftes of his falſe doctrine?</p>
               <p>The ſame is fallen out in our time, and continueth yet, euen euery day. For there are diuers which are in ſuch ſort blinded, &amp; before hand poſſeſſed with the darkneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the prince of this world, that they doe not onely deſpiſe all true religion and doctrine, but alſo they inforce and ſtraine them ſelues, to bring into credite and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation all the dreames, dotages, raylings, and falſe opinions of Antichriſt, and his inſtrumentes, in ſo much that for to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereto, they ceaſe not to make warre vpon the poore faithfull people, deſiring with a burning affection, the ſheading of their bloud. Who is he then which dare ſay, that ſuch people are not verie worthie and meete to be deliuered vnto Sathan, that they may be ſo made drunken with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deadly poiſon of his falſe doctrine, as they may neuer after be able to taſte or ſmel, the ſweetnes &amp; pleaſantnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God? To be ſhort, then in that the diuell hath ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:25134:51"/>
great a ſway in the world, it is a very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſigne (or as a man would ſay, a banner diſplayed) of the iuſt vengeance of GOD, and of his horrible and fearefull furie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe, who reiect and perſecute the Goſpell of his ſonne. For the vngodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering in their vnbeliefe, deſerue to be couered and clothed with ſo great abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ſeeing that the trueth of GOD, can finde no place amongſt them.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:25134:52"/>
whom the Romiſh Catholikes make them ſelues to beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is the head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church, as being the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſte on earth, and the lawfull or right ſucceſſour of Saint Peter. But we haue here two pointes to examine and ſift: the one touching Saint Peter: The other tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Pope, who ſaith that he is his ſucceſſour.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, we ſhall not finde in all the ſcriptures, that S. Peter was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at any time to be head of the whole Church, and to beare rule ouer it, neither that he him ſelf did at any time, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or vſurpe, ſuch a iuriſdiction and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, bicauſe it did not at any hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him, but vnto Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as we hope to proue, and manifeſtly to ſhewe it by the reaſons following.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is this. Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is called the head of the Churche. Epheſians 1. verſe 22. Epheſians 5. verſe 23.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.22. Epheſ. 5.23.</note> Saint Peter then is not, otherwiſe the Churche ſhould be a bodye with two heads.</p>
               <p>If they wil replie, and ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt indeede is the onely head of the Church, bicauſe that he alone reigneth ouer it,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25134:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that by his owne onely authoritie, yet that this nothing hindreth, but that there may be an other head miniſteriall (as they call it) that is to ſay, one in reſpect of the execution of the charge and office vnder him, who ſhould be his great Vicar and liuetenant generall, for to gouerne the Church, I will demaund of them to ſhewe me, when and howe this miniſteriall head, was ordained by Ieſus Chriſt: for if Ieſus Chriſt be God liuing for euer,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note> what neede hath he of a ſucceſſour? If we haue all his will in writing,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.15. Act. 20.27. Matt. 18.18.28.20.</note> and if he be alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the middeſt of his Church, to rule and gouerne the ſame, what hath he to doe for a Vicar or Lieuetenant? And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning charges and offices, we know what executors he hath eſtabliſhed and left. S. Paul in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt being aſcended into heauen, hath giuen ſome Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſome Euangeliſtes, ſome Paſtors, ſome teachers, to whome he hath giuen in charge, and committed his Church to order and guide the ſame.</hi> This is not ſpoken onely, for two or three, or for ſome other ſmall number, neither yet for one age, but for all the Paſtours of the Church generally,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:25134:53"/>
and for all times. Nowe you may ſee what lieutenantes Ieſus Chriſte hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his place: but that he ſhoulde giue vnto Peter a primacie, to bee Pope and heade of the Church, is a meere lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon is this: Ieſus Chriſt onely is the foundation of the Church 1.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.11.</note> Corinth. 3.11. Wherevpon it followeth, that the Church is founded vppon Ieſus Chriſt, and at no hande vpon Saint Peter, and by conſequent that Ieſus Chriſt alone is the heade of the Church, and not Saint Peter. Touching that which Ieſus Chriſt ſpeake vnto Peter: <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 16.18.</note> 
                  <hi>and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this rocke I will builde my Church,</hi> we wil anon declare the true and naturall ſenſe thereof.</p>
               <p>The thirde reaſon. S. Peters charge &amp; office was limited and ſet within certaine bondes: For S. Paul witneſſeth of himſelfe and Peter thus,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>That he was the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, and Saint Peter of the Iewes:</hi> And ſaith, that this diuiſion was made, by the reuelation and ordinaunce of GOD. It followeth then that Saint Peter was not an vniuerſall Apoſtle, nor a ſoueraigne &amp; high biſhoppe ouer all the Church: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:25134:54"/>
Saint Paul ſhoulde haue done ill in ſo limiting &amp; hedging in as it were, the the charge and office of his Apoſtleſhip, yea and that eighteene yeares after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Ieſus Chriſt. But I would wiſh the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe Catholikes, to take ſome better viewe of and heede to this reaſon. For if their Pope, ſnatch and take vnto himſelfe the primacie, for this reaſon, becauſe hee is Saint Peters ſucceſſors, he muſt then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his primacie or popedome ouer the Iewes and preach vnto them the Goſpell, that hee may gaine them and drawe them to Ieſus Chriſt, leauing vnto him whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he bee, that will take vppon him to be called the ſucceſſor of Saint Paul, primacie ouer the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: One wife hath but onely one husband, which is her head. But the Church is the ſpouſe of Chriſt.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2. Ephe. 5.22. Reue. 21.9.</note> 2. Cor. 11.2. Epheſians. 5.22. Reuelat: 21.9. The Church then hath none other but Chriſt alone for her husbande and head.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon: It is certaine, that Saint Peter vſed the power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which Ieſus Chriſte gaue him, for otherwiſe hee ſhoulde haue neglected his charge, and hidden his talent in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:25134:54"/>
and ſo by conſequent haue diſobeyed his Maſter, not ſeruing him purely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But ſo it is, hee neuer vſurped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny primacie ouer the other Apoſtles or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Church, for hee maketh himſelfe equal, to the other paſtors,<note place="margin">1. Peter. 5.1.21. &amp;c.</note> naming himſelf a paſtor and an Elder with them, and hee hath ſaide alſo, that it is not lawefull at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hande for anie man, to haue Lordſhip ouer the Lordes inheritaunces. Then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that hee receiued not anie prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or Lordſhippe from Ieſus Chriſt, ouer the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The ſixth reaſon:<note place="margin">Act. 8.14.</note> Saint Peter was ſent together with Iohn into Samaria by the other Apoſtles. Nowe if hee had beene the head of the Church, and had had rule and authoritie ouer the Apoſtles, it had apperteined vnto him to ſende others, &amp; not to others to ſend him.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth reaſon: If Saint Peter had had the right of primacie, to what end woulde he haue ſuffered himſelfe, to haue beene reproued by S. Paul, and that before the people?<note place="margin">In ſext. decr. de Con. cap. Licet. &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. 19. ca. ſi Roman. in Gloſſa &amp; de conceſ. prae. tit. 8. ca. pro. poſuit &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi.</note> for this was done euen then when hee both might and ought, to haue ſhewed his authoritie and rule. As at this day, the Pope who ſaith: that hee is aboue
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25134:55"/>
right, neither is helde or bounde by lawes: that he may preferre through his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation equitie vnwritten, before lawe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: that wee ought to allowe or diſſallow all that he alloweth or diſalloweth: that he is not ſubiect to any cenſure, hauing all lawe and right in the coffer of his breſte and ſtomacke. Now Saint Peter did not alledge any whit or parte of all theſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, but tooke in good worth Saint Paules cenſure and reproofe, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelfe his companion and fellowe, and one that was ioyned with him &amp; the other Apoſtles in felloweſhippe of office, yea inferiour to the whole bodie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the admonitions and cenſures of his brethren.</p>
               <p>The eight reaſon: So it was, that among the Apoſtles, in the time that our Sauiour Chriſt was bodily conuerſant with them,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.24. &amp;c.</note> there was a controuerſie which of them ſhoulde bee eſteemed or iudged the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, but Chriſt laboreth to bring them to humilitie, and to take from amongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ambition, ſaying thus: <hi>The kinges of the nations beare rule, and they which exerciſe authoritie ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are called Gratious lords, but ye ſhall not be ſo: But let the greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:25134:55"/>
you be as the leaſt, and the cheifeſt as he that ſerueth:</hi> And afterwardes hee ſetteth himſelfe foorth for an example. <hi>For who is greater, he that ſitteth at Table or he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, is not he that ſitteth at the table? And I am among you, as he that ſerueth: and ye are they which haue continued with mee, in my temptations.</hi> Laſtly he concludeth: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath appointed to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are our principal reaſons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Saint Peter was not appointed Lorde ouer the Church, and that hee had no more authoritie or preheminence in it, than the other Apoſtles, his companions and fellowes had. Nowe let vs heare the contrarie reaſons, which the Romiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes make.</p>
               <p>The firſte is this:<note place="margin">Matt. 16.18.</note> Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid to Saint Peter, <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke, I will builde my Church.</hi> It followeth then that Saint Peter, is the foundation of the Churche, and by conſequent the head thereof.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere, that the holy ſpirite, is not contrarie to it ſelfe: but hee hath ſpoken plainely to the Corinthians: <hi>That Ieſus Chriſte alone, is the onely foundation of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:25134:56"/>
Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>and that none can lay anie other, than that which is laide alreadie:</hi> Therefore he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth not in that place of S. Matthewe, the contrarie to this. And marke this deed, Ieſus Chriſt hath not ſaid: and vpon thee, O Peter, I will builde my Church: but: &amp; vpon this rocke, I will builde. And what meaneth this, vpon this rocke? Let vs heare S. Auguſtine. <hi>The Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the rocke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. in Iohan. tract. 124. ca. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>of which rocke Peter hath taken his name, for the rocke is not ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of Peter, but Peter is ſo named of the rocke; as Chriſt hath not taken his name of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but Christians of Chriſt. Therefore the Lord ſaith, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this rocke I wil build my Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Peter had confeſſed, thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God. He ſaith therefore, vpon this rock which thou hast confeſſed I will build my Church. For the rock was Chriſt, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter alſo himſelfe was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Marke what S. Auguſtine ſaith. S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe &amp; S. Chryſoſtome, vnderſtand this to be ſpoken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith which is Chriſt, &amp; not as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope doth, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſon of Peter. S. Ambroſe ſaith thus:<note place="margin">Amb. in epl. ad Ephe. ca. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſus Chriſt ſaid to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: &amp; vpon this rocke I wil build my Church, that is to ſay, vpon this confeſſion of Catholike faith, I will eſtabliſhe the faithfull vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25134:56"/>
life.</hi> Chryſoſtome ſaith alſo:<note place="margin">Chriſo. Ser. 21. de Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſus Christ ſaith: Thou art Peter, and vppon this rocke I will builde my Church. Hee ſaith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this rocke, and not vpon Peter: For he hath founded or ſet his Church not vppon man, but vpon the faith and confeſſion of Peter. And what was this faith and confeſſion? Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon is:<note place="margin">Matth. 16.19</note> Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen the keyes vnto Peter, he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed him head of the Church.</p>
               <p>I denie the conſequent. For by the vſe of the keyes is vnderſtoode not the rule or ouerſight of the whole Church, but the power, to binde and looſe, or elſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or not pardon ſinnes, as it is declared,<note place="margin">Matt. 18.18. Iohn. 20.23.</note> in the 18. Chapter of the Goſpell after S. Mathewe, and Chap. 20. after S. Iohn. Now ſeeing that ſo it is, that power to remitte or to retaine ſinnes was giuen, not vnto Peter onely, but equally vnto all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it followeth well, that the vſe of the keyes was not giuen to Saint Peter alone, but alſo to all his companions &amp; fellowes, &amp; by conſequent, if he were the head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keyes was giuen, it would follow that the Church had ſo many heads, as it had then Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:25134:57"/>But ſome will ſay, Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh onely to Peter. It is true indeede. Howe beit by the name of Peter is vnderſtoode the whole Church. For euen as Ieſus Chriſt was willing to heare, what iudgement not onely Peter, but alſo all his fellowes had of him, when he demaunded of them, <hi>But what ſay ye that I am?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 16.15.16.</note> And that Peter alone in the name of all anſwered and made this confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Christ the ſonne of the liuing God:</hi> So on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide Ieſus Chriſt, giuing the power of the keyes vnto the Church, addreſſed his ſpeache vnto Peter alone, although he meant to ſpeake as wel vnto all the reſt.<note place="margin">Augu. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han tract. 50</note> And ſo doth Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine vnderſtande it: for beholde howe he ſpeaketh. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſignifieth the whole Church. For if that in Peter there were not the figure of the Church, Christ would not haue ſaide vnto him, I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And agane, <hi>when Ieſus Chriſt ſaide vnto Peter, I will giue vnto thee the keyes &amp;c. Hee ment without doubt the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon would be marked, why Ieſus Chriſt, in the perſon of one ſpake vnto all: that is, to the ende hee might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend and ſet the vnitye of the Church,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:25134:57"/>
euen as alſo the ancient writers haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; obſerued the ſame.<note place="margin">Cypri. tract. 3. de ſimpli. praelat.</note> S. Cyprian ſaith thus. <hi>Our Lord in the perſon of one man, hath giuen the keyes vnto all, thereby to denote and ſet out the vnitie of all. The other wer the ſame in deede that Peter was, fellowes in equall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in equal power. But Ieſus began with one man, to the end to ſhew, that the Church is one.</hi> And Auguſtine:<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Iohan. tract. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>So it was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all were asked: Peter alone anſwered him, thou art Chriſt &amp;c. &amp; to him was it ſaid, I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, as though power to bind and loſe, had bene giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him alone. But as he anſwered for al, ſo he receiued the keyes together with all, bearing as it were the perſon of vnitie. Wherefore he alone was named for all, bicauſe there was vnitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The third reaſon is:<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.16.</note> Ieſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Peter aboue al the reſt, yea and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three times, to feed his ſheepe. He then did conſtitute and make him an vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and head of all Churches.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere, that this conſequent is falſe, for there is a very great not only differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but contraritie betwene theſe two, to haue charge to feed the ſheepe of Chriſt, and to haue a moſt high Empire, &amp; vniuerſall rule
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:25134:58"/>
ouer the whole Church. Beſides, if to feede the ſheepe of Chriſt, be no other thing, but to miniſter &amp; giue vnto them, the ſpiritual foode of their ſoules, by the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel,<note place="margin">Matt. 28.19. Mark. 16.15.</note> as it is indeed: and ſeeing that it is moſt euident and plaine, that Ieſus Chriſte hath giuen this commiſſion, to all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles generally, it followeth verie well, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to Peter alone. And indeed Peter him ſelf doth wel confeſſe the ſame,<note place="margin">1. Peter. 1.5. &amp;c.</note> when he exhorteth his fellow miniſters, to feede the flocke of Chriſt, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. And Baſil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſaying: <hi>Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe teacheth vs this, (to wit, that he is the only head of the Church) who did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitute &amp; appoint Peter the paſtor of his church, after him. For he ſaith, Peter, loueſt thou me? feede my ſheepe: and conſequently, he hath giuen this verie ſame power to all Paſtors &amp; teachers, and hereof this is a certaine ſigne and ſure token, that all bind and loſe without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference, as well as he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: S. Peter is diuers times in the Scripture named y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt among the Apoſtles. Therefore he was choſen to haue rule aboue the other his fellowes, yea aboue or ouer the whole Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwere firſt, that this argument is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:25134:58"/>
and vaine, yea worthie to be moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and hiſſed at. For be it that we confeſſe that S. Peter was the firſt and chiefe as it were amongſt a fewe people, that is to ſay, amongſt the twelue Apoſtles, yet very farr fet is this, that it ſhould therefore followe, that he was the firſt or chiefeſt ouer all Chriſtians, or that he did beare rule ouer all the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if bicauſe that S. Peter is the firſt named, he is therfore the firſt &amp; chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt among the Apoſtles, we muſt then ſay by the contrarie, that the virgine Marie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt and leaſt of all women, bicauſe in the firſt chapter of the Actes,<note place="margin">Act. 1.13.14.</note> where alſo S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſet the firſt in the catalogue or nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, ſhe is ſet the laſt after others. Which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Romiſh Catholikes will not at any hand ſay or affirme: which if they ſhould, it would be found in deede a verie abſurde thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we read in many places, that S. Peter is not named firſt. And S. Paul in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note> placeth Iames before him. Iames then by this reaſon, ſhould haue authoritie ouer Peter, bicauſe he is named before him. Beſides in the Councel of Ieruſalem, the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:25134:59"/>
ſpeach &amp; aduice of Iames which was had, after that Peter had giuen his,<note place="margin">Act. 15.13. &amp;c.</note> had ſuch weight with it, that all conſented and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to his iudgement.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the firſt point. Let vs come to the other which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Pope, who ſaith, that he is Saint Peters ſucceſſor, and ſo by conſequent the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it manifeſtly appeare by that which hath bene ſaid heretofore, that Saint Peter was neuer eſtabliſhed head of the Church, and that he neuer had any ſuch preheminence and authoritie attributed vnto him, by what title or right can or will the Pope (who ſaith that he is his ſucceſſor) pretend at this day, any ſuch Lordſhip, rule and authoritie?</p>
               <p>Let vs alſo on the other ſide well marke this. S. Peter died (as they ſay) vnder Nero, and there ſucceeded him, Lucius, Cletus, &amp; Clemens, in the time of S. Iohn, who liued vnder Domitian, and euen vnto Traian his dayes. Now if they of the Church of Rome will ſay, that the Popes which ſucceeded S. Peter, were the heads of the Church, to whome all the reſt of the Biſhops ought to be ſubiect, they muſt of neceſſitie be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25134:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to confeſſe, that S. Iohn was ſubiect to Lucius, to Cletus, and to Clemens.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if S. Peters ſucceſſors be the heads of the Church, Clemens who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the third place (as they ſay) was ſo likewiſe. But let vs heare what he him ſelfe ſaith in an Epiſtle, which (as ſome ſay) he writ to Iames Biſhop of Ieruſalem.<note place="margin">Tom. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. pag. 135. col. 2.</note> The title or inſcription is this: Clemens, to Iames the Lords brother, Biſhop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, gouernour of the Church of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and of all other Churches which by the prouidence of God, are throughout all the world. If Clemens were the vniuerſall Biſhop, why did he ſpoyle him ſelfe of his owne titles, to attribute, aſcribe, and giue the ſame vnto Iames, to whome they did not belong?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, who is he that hath lifted vp the Pope into this goodly degree of honor? Is it Ieſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles? No in deede: for we reade, that Bonifaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the third of that name Biſhop of Rome, was by the Emperour Phocas ordained the firſt ſouereigne or chiefe of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and the Chuuch of Rome, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed head of all the Churches in the world? &amp; this was about the yere of Chriſt

               <p>This Phocas (as the hiſtorie writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe and record) was a traitor and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful murderer of the Emperor Mauriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us his maſter: for as the ſaid Mauritius at a certaine time, ſhewed him ſelf ouer ſeuere and rigorous againſt his ſouldiers, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen to debate and contention, choſe Phocas for Emperor, who in Calcedonia immediately cauſed to be cut off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Mauritius his owne head, his armes alſo, and his three ſonnes named Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Tiberius, and Conſtantine. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his paiment and reward for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For hauing reigned eight yeares, he was at the laſt ſlaine by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the yeare of Chriſt 612. Behold and marke by whome the primacie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church was eſtabliſhed, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Biſhop made an vniuerſall Biſhop, there being before, not ſo much as any newes of it.

But the biſhops of Aſia tooke this in ſuch ſorte, that they obteyned of the councel of Antioch, that letters ſhould be written to Iulius Biſhoppe of Rome, by which there ſhould be declared vnto him, that he did attribute and take vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, an authoritie which did not at anye hande belong vnto him, and that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee offered greate wronge to other Churches, and other Biſhoppes.

               <p>Moreouer, let vs conſider by what to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and markes, the Pope of Rome ſaith that he is Saint Peters ſucceſſour.

               <p>But touching the firſt, it is vncerteine, whether Saint Peter was Biſhop of Rome or no, at the leaſt, whether he bare rule there and helde the ſeat.

Antioch Can. 13.</note> that the Councels haue limitted to all the Patriarches (who were many &amp; diuers) yea euen after that thei were brought to foure, their ſeueral charges, making them Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes, euerie one in his own prouince, the Biſhop of Rome, hauing no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer others, than others ouer him? For at that time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhop of Rome might verie wel haue alledged S. Peters ſeate, and the other Biſhops &amp; Councels, would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel haue confeſſed and allowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, if it had bene true, and if the ſame could rightly haue giuen the title of primacie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhop of Rome. On the other ſide what an argument is this? S. Peter was Biſhop of Rome, &amp; there ſuffered martyrdome: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this Church is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and miſtreſſe of al the reſt, and that the Biſhop therof is the vniuerſall and general head of all Chriſtendome. Verily if in this reſpect, the queſtion be to eſtabliſhe and ſet vp a primacie, it ought rather to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at Ieruſalem than at Rome. For Saint

Peter preached there,<note place="margin">Act. 2.14. Act. 2.12.</note> yea the firſt after Chriſtes aſcention, where he together with his fellowes and brethren builded vp the Church,<note place="margin">Act. 4.3.</note> did great miracles, was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,<note place="margin">Act. 5.18.</note> and ſundrie times perſecuted. The Prophets likewiſe preached there, and all the Apoſtles, yea which is more, Ieſus Chriſt him ſelf,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.13. &amp; 7.14. &amp; 8.2. &amp;c. 18.20</note> died there and roſe againe, and from thence aſcended vp into heauen. There alſo was the firſt Synode, that euer was held in the Chriſtian Church, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of all the Apoſtles. There alſo Ieſus Chriſt ſent downe his holie ſpirit vpon his Apoſtles and diſciples.<note place="margin">Act. 15.6. &amp;c. Act. 2.1. &amp;c.</note> And to be ſhort, from thence it was that the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, ſhould come foorth, to be ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad throughout al the world,<note place="margin">Iſai. 2.3. Michah. 4.2.</note> euen as the Prophets had before told: which things we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not after any ſort ſay or affirme of Rome.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if we muſt reſpect and regard the Apoſtles, there is as much, or rather more reaſon, to make S. Paule the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Pope of Rome, as S. Peter. For in the firſt place beſides that he was not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing leſſe or inferior to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or chiefe Apoſtles,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.5.</note> we finde not that S. Peter did at any time reproue him in his miniſterie,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.11.</note> as he reproued or blamed S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:25134:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And beſides we haue a certaine and an aſſured teſtimonie in the holie ſcripture touching S. Paul,<note place="margin">Act. 23.11. Act. 28.30.31.</note> that he was ſent by GOD to Rome, there to beare witneſſe of him, &amp; that he there preached the kingdome of God, two whole yeres together: that from thence he writ diuers Epiſtles to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that he was there priſoner, and at the laſt beheaded by Nero. And as touching Peter, we haue no aſſured teſtimonie that he went to Rome, or that he taried there exerciſing there the miniſterie. If they wil replie, that Ieſus Chriſt gaue him the keies of the kingdome of heauen, and that by that meanes, he was preferred before Saint Paule, and made head of the Church, we haue aunſwered that heretofore, which we minde not hereto repeat.</p>
               <p>Beſides, though it were ſo that S. Peter was ordained to beare rule ouer all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as an Apoſtle, yet it can not therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followe, that his ſucceſſours ought to haue any ſuch right or authoritie as he: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they which ſucceeded the Apoſtles, haue not the ſame charge and the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that the Apoſtles had. For when Ieſus Chriſt ordained his twelue Apoſtles, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them for a time onely, and after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:25134:68"/>
he hath not ſubſtituted or ordained others in their place, to haue ſo ample and large a charge as theirs was: Likewiſe we read not, that the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their ſtead, but onely Elders and Auncients, that is to ſay, Paſtors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who had their callings, charges, and offices limitted. Wherefore albeit Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might well be an vniuerſall Biſhop, yet ſo it is that thoſe that came after him, can not rightly attribute vnto themſelues ſuch an office. But to conclude, by what marks can y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope brag that he is the ſucceſſor of Peter, whoſe office he doth not any maner of way execute, and whome he followeth not in any thing whatſoeuer?</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Whether the Church of Rome be the true and Catholike Church. And whether we doe well to ſeparate and withdrawe our ſelues from it.</head>
               <p>WHen we cal the aſſemblie of Papiſtes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Church, we mean not that we hold or take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Church. For we take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word Church in his generall ſignification, for a companie or fellowſhip, or congregation. And indeed we hold and affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> among the Papiſts, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church is not, but only ſome little tract or path of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:25134:68"/>
a Church, to the end that that, which Saint Paule ſaith, may be accompliſhed, to wit, <hi>that Antechrist doth ſit as God in the temple of God.</hi> This being true,<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.4.</note> much leſſe can we ſay: that the aſſemblie which is amongeſt the Papiſtes, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholike Church: which point we proue by theſe reaſons folowing.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon: The true Church is founded or buided,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.20.</note> vpon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as S. Paul ſaith: but the Papacie or Popedome, hath not any ſuch foundation, bicauſe that it hath ouerthrowne the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as may plainly appeare by the examination of their traditions. The Popedome therefore is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.7.15.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth ſhould reigne &amp; beare ſway, for S. Paul ſaith, <hi>the church is the piller and ground of truth:</hi> but in the Papacie truth reigneth not, but on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie ſide falſhod &amp; lying, as appeareth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the Maſſe, of Purgatorie, of invocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or praier to Saints, of idols, of merits, and other ſuch matters. Wherfore it foloweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or popedome is not the true Church.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: The true Church,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2. Epheſ. 5.22.</note> is the ſpouſe or wife of Chriſt: But the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Rome is not the ſpouſe of Chriſt.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25134:69"/>
For the ſpouſe of Chriſt contenteth her ſelfe with Chriſt her only husband, euen as an honeſt woman, doth content her ſelfe, with her only husband, without admitting or ſuffering any other with or beſides him: which the Romiſh Church doth not, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe receiueth the Pope of Rome for her husband, and ioyneth him together with Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore it followeth, that the Romiſh Church is not the true Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: The true Churche is the ſheepfold of Ieſus Chriſtes ſheepe.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.16.</note> But the Popedome is not the ſheepfold of Chriſtes ſhepe, for it heareth not the voice of Chriſt the true Paſtor or ſheepheard, but the voice of a ſtranger, that is, of the Pope, whoſe lawes it foloweth, and keepeth more then the lawes of Chriſt. The papacie then, or popedome is not the true Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.23.</note>The fift reaſon: The true Church is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt: but the Romiſh Church is not the body of Chriſt. For the body of Chriſt contenteth it ſelfe with Chriſt, the onely head therof, otherwiſe it ſhould be a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with two heades, as we haue declared before in the ſeuenth chapter: which thing the Romiſh Church doth not, bicauſe it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:25134:69"/>
receiueth and holdeth the Pope for her heade. Wherefore it followeth verie well, that the Romiſhe Church is not the true Church.</p>
               <p>The ſixt reaſon: Though it were that Church of Rome, were the true Church, yet it could not be but a particular church, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Church of Corinthus, Epheſus, and others, wherevppon it followeth, that it is not, neither can be the Catholike and vniuerſall Church.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth reaſon: In the true Church theſe three markes are founde without fayling: that is to ſay: the lawful calling of paſtors, the pure preaching of the worde, &amp; the right adminiſtration of ſacraments. but in the Romiſhe Church, theſe three markes are not to be founde, as it is eaſie to ſhewe, by the examination that a man might make thereof. Wherof it followeth, that the Romiſhe Church is not the true and right Church.</p>
               <p>Nowe ſeeing that wee haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, that the Church of Rome, is not the Catholike Church, neither yet the true Church, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt not deme it ſtrange, that we can not agree with it, but that we depart and ſeperate our ſelues from it: and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:25134:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in ſo doing, we ought not at any hand, or any manner of way to be held &amp; accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Schiſmatiks, becauſe we do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, the auncient and Catholike Church, no not the auncient Romaine Church, but doe altogether agree with the ſame. For would we knew, what manner of Church, the church of Rome was in auntient time? Tertullian teacheth it vs,<note place="margin">Tertul. de praeſcr. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic.</note> when hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth therof, after this maner: <hi>A bleſſed Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che, for which the Apostles haue ſpred abroad all the doctrine with their bloude: where Saint Peter ſuffered ſuch a death, as the Lorde him ſelfe did: where Paul was crowned with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome: where Iohn the Apostle was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to burning or flaming oyle, &amp; yet was taken out of the ſame, without any hurte or bliſter, and afterwardes ſent into exile. Let vs looke vpon that which ſhe learned, and that which ſhee taught, and what concorde and agreement ſhe hath had with the Churches of Affrica. She hath acknowledged, confeſſed, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one onely God the creator of all thinges, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, borne of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Marie: ſhee hath beleeued alſo the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the fleſhe: ſhe hath receaued the law and the Prophetes, with the writinges as well of the Euangeliſtes as of the Apostles, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25134:70"/>
from thence ſhe draweth or fetcheth faith: ſhe marketh hers with the ſacramente of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and ſhee clotheth them with the holy Ghoste: ſhee nouriſheth them with the ſacramentes of the ſupper: ſhee exhorteth by martrydome, and ſhe receiueth not any perſon againſt ſuch inſtruction.</hi> Beholde Tertullian his wordes. wherefore wee haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken this auncient Church of Rome, but the newe and particular Romiſh Church, which ſince hath lifted vp her ſelfe, which aduoucheth the Pope for her heade, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him for the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt on earth, which worſhippeth him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth his lawes againſte the lawes of GOD. For ſhee hath degenerated and gone out of kinde, and hath loſte all her authoritie, euen as the cleargie of the ſaide Church hath ſometimes foretolde, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Saint Cyprian ſaying:<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. 2. epiſt. 7. Rom. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>That the prayſe that Saint Paule gaue to that Church, to wit, that their fayth was ſpreade abroad, and publiſhed throughout all the worlde, ſhould bee turned to their ſhame &amp; diſpraiſe, if they went out of kind, &amp; became baſtards, and if they continued not to bee heires of the ſame faith.</hi> And by this departure from her, we haue declared the obedience which wee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25134:71"/>
owe vnto God, who hath commaunded vs to doe ſo ſaying: <hi>Goe out of Babylon, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that ye receiue not of her plagues:</hi> And haue receiued the counſell of Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, who ſaith: <hi>If there bee any Churche, which refuſeth the faith, and keepeth not the foundation or groundworkes of the Apostles preaching, wee must leaue her, leaſt ſhe bring with her the infection of error and vnbeliefe.</hi> This hee hath written vppon the ninth chapter of the Goſpell according to Saint Luke.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay: ye account the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of Germanie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church, though ye find there many things to be amended, as concerning the ſupper it ſelfe, and ſome other ceremonies, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make you not the like accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome? I aunſweare, that it is very true that there is ſome controuerſie betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Germaines and vs, touching ſome poyntes of religion, but it is not in reſpecte of the eſſentiall or ſubſtantiall poyntes thereof. I call them eſſentiall or ſubſtantiall points, that are ſo of the ſubſtance of religion that if men erre in one point, the ſame cannot ſubſiſte or ſtande, for euen in that which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:25134:71"/>
concerneth the holy ſupper, wee all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that wee are partakers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloude of Chriſt. The difference is not, but in that Conſubſtantiation, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they maintaine, which is not of ſuch great importance and weight as tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh pretendeth: which euen in that one point ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and vtterly bringeth to nothing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, putting an idole of bread in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of the ſonne of God: &amp; making of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a creator, &amp; a Chriſt ſubiect to corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, raſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foundation, &amp; turning topſie turuie, as wee ſay, that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the proprietie, the nature and the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt his bodie. All which abhominations and idolatries, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans that are reformed, doe deteſt and ſet them ſelues againſt, as well as we.</p>
               <p>But if ſome that are willing to make diuorce as it were and ſeparation, between the Germanes and vs will alledge that the foreſaide Germans, haue not the like opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of vs, that we haue of them, and that they holde and account vs for heretikes, as may bee ſeene and proued by certayne writinges which they haue ſet abrode and publiſhed: we anſwere, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:25134:72"/>
and heates of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, who haue written ſomewhat more freely, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould, ought not ſo to be regarded and eſteemed, that thervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they will make a generall concluſion of all the reſt, and ſo prooue that there is a diuiſion betweene all them and vs. For albeit, there bee ſome diuerſitie betweene them &amp; vs in this point touching the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and in ſome certayne ceremonies, yet vnitie doeth not therefore ceaſe, to continue and remayne alwayes amongeſt vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 5 cap. 22.</note>Socrates, who writ the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, ſayth thus: <hi>There is not any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which obſerueth the ſame ceremonies though it doe receiue and admitte one and the ſelfe doctrine touching ceremonies.</hi> And indeede they which haue the ſame faith, ſometimes differ amongeſt themſelues, touching ſome ceremonies and obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Irenaeus writing to Victor the Biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 5. cap. 26.</note> rehearſeth that there was great diuerſitie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches, touching faſting, and the celebration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſt of Eaſter: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he addeth: <hi>Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding though there were diuerſitie amongeſt all theſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25134:72"/>
ceremonies, yet ſo it was that they did alwayes agree with vs: and the diſcord or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about fasting, did not breake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or vnitie of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then following theſe places wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that we leaue not of to acknowledg the companie of the reformed Germanes for the true Church, although that we be not in euerie poynt and throughly agreed with them, touching ſome matter conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the ſupper, and ſome ceremonies obſerued amongeſt them.</p>
               <p>And the rule of charitie teacheth vs this, as Saint Paul hath giuen vs a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2. 2. Cor. 1.1. Galat. 1.2.</note> when he calleth the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and the Galathians, <hi>Saintes and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones,</hi> and giueth vnto them in generall the name of the Church, although there were amongeſt them great and greeuous faultes, as well in ignorance of the doctrin, as in their owne life and manners. This is that alſo which hee hath ſet foorth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſaying: <hi>That all they which hold and keepe the foundation, do not alwayes build gold and ſiluer and pretious ſtones, but haye &amp; ſtubble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome ſay, why follow you not the ſame rule, on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behalf of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Rome?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:25134:73"/>
we anſwere, that in the ceremonies &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Romiſhe Church, the puritie of religion is not there obſerued &amp; kept, but the whole ſeruice of God, is amongeſt them corrupted and falſified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can not with out offending God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie or frame our ſelues vnto them. And Saint Auguſtine hath giuen vs this leſſon, teaching vs howe farre wee may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in the ceremonies and ſeruice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches.<note place="margin">Auguſt. ad Ianuarium.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no better rule in this behalfe</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>than a wiſe and ſober Christian himſelfe, which will frame himſelfe to that cuſtome, which he ſhall ſee vſed in that Church, wherein he liueth. For that which is not eſtabliſhed against faith, or againſt good manners, muſt bee helde for indifferent. But the Church alloweth not that, which is againſt faith and good life, yea ſhe diſſembleth it not, neither doeth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſhorte then, for ſo much as wee cannot be preſent, at the ſeruice and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Romiſh Church, without defiling our ſelues in their manifeſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, you may ſee wherefore we doe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether renounce and forſake the ſame. And in this deede of ours, wee followe the example of the Prophets. For
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25134:73"/>
in the kingdome of Iſrael in the dayes of Ieroboam, Circumciſion was adminiſtred, and there they offered ſacrifices: yea the lawe was eſteemed there amongſt them as holie, and which is more, GOD him ſelfe was called vpon, and prayed to there: yet notwithſtanding, by reaſon of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and ceremonies, which men had deuiſed and ſet vp againſt the ordinance of God, all that ſeruice was reiected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: neither can any man ſhewe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, or any other, whether he were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or of any other calling, did at any time worſhip, or offer vp ſacrifice in Bethell. But ſee more largely touching this matter, in that which M. Caluine hath written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the fourth booke of his Inſtitutions Chap. 2. ſect. 1.2.3.4.5.<note place="margin">Caluin. lib. 4 Inſtit. ca. 2. ſect. 1.2.3.4.5. &amp;c.</note> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when we doe thus ſeparate our ſelues from the Romiſh Church, we breake not the vnitie of the Church, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the Romiſh Church, there is no true vnitie. For firſt of all, it is not at v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in it ſelfe, as appeareth by the ſeuerall ſects and rules which are amongeſt them, one ſaying, I am of the order of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine: an other, I am of Saint Dominicke his order: and other, I am of S. Frauncis: an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25134:74"/>
I am a Ieſuite, contrarie to that which S. Paul writ to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.11.12.13.</note> in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Church is not vnited with God, which vnion or vnitie, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ioyned with the former,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.3.</note> as S. Iohn declareth it. And that this is true, that it hath not any vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or felowſhip with God, it is ſufficiently plaine by this only reaſon, that he that hath vnion or fellowſhip with God, ought by the teſtimonie of the holie ſpirit and by faith to be aſſured hereof, that God dwelleth in him, and he in God, euen as the ſcripture teacheth vs. But the faith of Papiſts is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt alwayes doubt, whether we be in the grace and fauour of God: wherefore they can not haue vnion or fellowſhip with him. Furthermore, this is to be marked, that there is no vnion or agreement, betweene the doctrine of Papiſtes and the word of God, wherevpon it followeth, that they are not at all vnited with him. Which being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, to what end and purpoſe would they haue vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and abide in the vnitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Church, ſeeing there is not in it any vnitie, I meane holie vnitie, and ſuch as agreeth well to good Chriſtians, and the true

               <p>Wherefore we eſteeme and take the baptiſme of the Romiſh Church, for true baptiſme, bicauſe it is miniſtred, not in the name of the Pope, but in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, &amp; of the holy Ghoſt: and confeſſe that the infants which receiue it, are truely baptiſed, euen as they which were circumciſed in the time of Ieroboam and of Caiaphas were helde for true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſons, although at that time the ſtate of the Church was almoſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peruerted and corrupted.

bring in place here,<note place="margin">Caluin. lib. 4 Inſt. cap. 2. ſect. 11.12.</note> contenting my ſelfe therewith. <hi>As in the time of Ieroboam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there were certaine prerogatiues belonging to the Church, which remained amongest the Iewes, although at that time the ſeruice of God was very much corrupted: ſo we denie not, but that the Papiſtes haue at this day, ſome ſteppes &amp; pathes, of the diſſipation or ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Church, which through the grace of God haue remained with them. For as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion could not be ſo defiled, by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane handes of the Iewes, but that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a ſigne and a ſacrament, of the couenant of God, for which cauſe, God called the infants or children, which were borne of this people his, which could not any manner of way belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but by a certaine ſpeciall bleſſing and priuiledge. After the ſame maner alſo, bicauſe he hath once placed his couenant in Fraunce, in Italie, in Germanie, and other countreyes, (although that all that was afterwards oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the tyrannie of Antechriſt) yet to the end that his couenant might remaine amongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuiolable and vnbroken, it hath pleaſed him, that baptiſme ſhuld there remain for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie &amp; witneſſe of that couenant, which bicauſe it is ordained and hallowed by his owne mouth, retaineth and keepeth her owne force, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

And as ſometimes buildings are pulled downe in ſuch ſort, that the foundations remaine, and ſome ſhewes of the ruines and deſtructions: ſo the Lord hath not ſuffered, that his Church ſhould be ſo raſed or deſtroyed by Antichrist, that nothing of the building ſhould remaine: And although (that he might take vengeance of the vnthankefulnes of men who despiſed his word) he hath ſuffered ſuch a horrible ſhaking and fall to be made, yet it was his pleaſure, that ſome part or portion thereof ſhould remaine, as a ſigne, token and marke, that the whole was not aboliſhed.</hi>

                  <hi>Wherfore when we refuſe, ſimplie to graunt vnto the Papistes the title of the Church, we doe not therefore vtterly denie them, that they haue not any Churches amongeſt them: but we onely reaſon, of the true and right estate of the Church: which importeth a fellowſhip, as well in the doctrine, as in al that which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the profeſſion of our Chriſtianitie.</hi>

Nowe ſeeing it is ſaide, that the ſeate of Antichriſt ſhall be in the temple of GOD, thereby is meant, that his kingdome ſhall be ſuch, as ſhall not altogether aboliſh the name, either of Christ, or of his Church. Hereby ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appeareth, that we denie not, but that the Churches, ouer which he beareth rule by his tyrannie, remaine Churches ſtill: but we ſay, that he hath prophaned them by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, and ſo poiſoned them with his falſe doctrines, that there appeareth amongeſt them a picture or image of Babylon, rather than of the holie citie of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude, we ſay that they be Churches, firſt, bicauſe that the Lord hath miraculouſly preſerued amongeſt them the remnants of his people, though they be poorely and thinly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad. Secondly, bicauſe there remaine amongeſt them ſome markes and tokens of the Church, ſpecially theſe tokens, the power and effectualneſſe wherof can not be aboliſhed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the craft of the diuell, neither by the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice of men. But on the other ſide, bicauſe the markes, which we haue principally to regard in this dispute or question, be blotted out there,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25134:77"/>
we ſay, that there is not amongeſt them, a right ſhewe, and lawfull forme of a Church, neither in any of their particular aſſemblies, neither in the whole body.</hi> And theſe are the wordes of Caluine.</p>
               <p>But though we might indeede accord and agree to this, that the Romiſh Church were the true church, in reſpect of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme which it hath, yet there ſhould be no reaſon, to inferre therevpon, that we ought alſo to take &amp; hold it for the true Church, in reſpect of the other points of doctrine, for it is moſt manifeſt, that for the moſt part, they are altogether contrarie to the expreſſed word of God. And as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning baptiſme, albeit they adde many vaine and ſuperſtitious ceremonies, miniſtred in a tongue vnknowne to the people, and not vnderſtoode of them, yet ſo it is, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſubſtance remaineth, &amp; that which is the principall or chiefe point of the forme, as we haue ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now if one would demaund: why then ſuffer we not our infants to be brought to the Romiſh Church, there to be baptiſed, ſeeing that the baptiſme which is there miniſtred, is good? I aunſwere, that we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it not, bicauſe God hath giuen vs grace
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:25134:77"/>
to knowe the ſuperſtition and idolatrie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.14 1. Iohn. 5.21.</note> which is there committed, to which we may not at any hande, ſticke, cleaue or conſent, what ſoeuer apparance and ſhew of good we ſuppoſe may come thereby either to vs, or to our children.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> for Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>That we ought carefully to looke vnto our ſelues, not to doe euill that good may come thereof.</hi> And alſo bicauſe that through gods grace and goodnes, we haue a meane &amp; way opened, to haue our foreſaid chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptiſed in the reformed Churches, without any abuſe, error, ſupperſtition, or idolatrie.</p>
               <p>They will ſay yet further, that Ieſus Chriſt ceaſed not to approue &amp; allow the Church of Ieruſalem in his time, though it had in it ſtore of errors: which he well declared, when he was there preſent at the ſacrifices and feaſtes. Wherefore then do not we approue alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it haue errors in it? For if a Church ſhall, for ſome abuſes, faultes, or errors, looſe the name of the true Church, where ſhall we then finde one alone in the whole worlde?</p>
               <p>I aunſwere firſte, that wee holde not that a true Church looſeth the name
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:25134:78"/>
of a true Church, for ſome abuſes or errors therein. For S. Paul left not of to name the faithfull people of Corinthus, the Church, although he blamed and reproued them, for many errors and corruptions, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of their manners, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their doctrine. And wee ſhall ſee hereafter that particular Churches, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo perfect in this worlde, but that they be oftentimes ſubiect to error and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray. But we rightly holde and affirme, that the Romiſh Church, ought to leeſe the name of a true Church, becauſe ſhee hath degenerated, and gone out of kinde from the auncient and Catholike Church. For the true, auncient &amp; Catholike church, cleaueth to her onely heade and husbande Ieſus Chriſt: ſhee beleeueth his worde &amp; followeth him: ſhee is faithfull to him, without committing adulterie with idols, which the Romiſhe Church doeth not, which thing wee haue a little while agoe ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as concerning that that Ieſus Chriſt did approue the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem in his time, we ſay in the firſt place, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is verie great difference, betweene the eſtate of that Church then as it was,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:25134:78"/>
and the eſtate of the Romiſh Church, ſuch a one as wee beholde it at this day. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuſe and corruption, as well of doctrine, as of ſacramentes, and the manifeſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which beareth ſwaye at this preſent in the Romiſhe Church, was not at that time in the Church of Ieruſalem. which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to prooue, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſte, would not haue made much a doe, to beat down the idoles, &amp; to reforme other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if they had had place there, as he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the tables of the monie chaungers,<note place="margin">Iohn. 2.14.</note> &amp; caſt out of the temple thoſe, that there ſolde openly, ſheepe, and doues.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Ieſus Chriſt woulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte or diſallow the Church of Ieruſalem, becauſe that the time was not yet come, wherein he ſhoulde put an ende vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ceremonies of the lawe.<note place="margin">Leuiti. 17.3 Deut. 12.13.</note> Wherefore for as much as the faithfull had the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God whereby it was appointed them not to ſearch or ſeeke newe places, to offer their ſacrifices &amp; oblations in, but to come, and to ſtaye them ſelues within the Court of the tabernacle, or of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ieſus Chriſt woulde not deſpiſe this place. But wee knowe, that whatſoeuer corruption was there, no faithfull man
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:25134:79"/>
was inforced to cleaue or ſticke, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye ſuperſtitious manner or cuſtome: which is not practiſed at this day in the Church of Rome. For as all there is of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and manifeſt idolatrie, ſo they will conſtraine and enforce the faithful by fire and ſworde to conſent thereto, and to pollute and defile themſelues therewith, againſt their owne conſciences, and gods expreſſe forbidding.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to what point did Ieſus Chriſt bring the Church of Ieruſalem, when the high Prieſtes, Scribes and Phariſees ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſelues great madde men, not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duties towardes it? did hee not take his vineyard from theſe husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who did not giue him the fruites whiche belonged vnto him, and committed the ſame vnto others, that is, to his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, to yelde him fruite in their ſeaſons? Euen ſo likewiſe hath the Lorde done therewith in the Popedome. He hath not deſtroyed his Church, but hath only chaunged the eſtate thereof, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it out of the hand and guiding of the Biſhoppes and Popiſhe Prieſtes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it againe vnder the gouernement and charge of other guiders and leaders, who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:25134:79"/>
can ſee more clerely, and be of better truſt: as it is ſpoken in Saint Mathewe,<note place="margin">Matt. 22.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To conclude: if they aske what ſhall become then of our predeceſſors, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith of the Romiſh Church: are they condemned? I aunſwere, that wee leaue the iudgement thereof vnto GOD: for it belongeth not to vs, to determine &amp; iudge of that which is hidden from vs, &amp; which indeed paſſeth our knowledge and calling. It is verie true,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.18.36</note> that the holy ſcripture pronounceth, that they which die without the faith of Chriſt, are damned: and we cannot but ſay amen, and giue our conſent to this.

                  <note place="margin">Euangeliſts.</note>Euangeliſtes generally are thoſe which performe the office of an Euangeliſt, that is to ſay, which preach the Goſpell. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25134:82"/>
alſo this name Euangeliſt, is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe foure, who haue written the ſtorie of the Goſpell, that is to ſay, S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe, S. Marke, S. Luke, and S. Iohn. But in this order of the Church, the queſtion is of an other charge or office. Theſe men of whome we ſpeake, were as it were fellowe helpers to the Apoſtles, whome they did followe, and were almoſt continually in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie with. And their office came ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nigh to the office of an Apoſtle: the difference was onely in the degree of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Of this ſort were Silas, Timothie, and ſuch like. In the one and twentie of the Actes, Philip is called an Euangeliſt:<note place="margin">Act. 21.8.</note> And Saint Paule admoniſheth Timothie in one of the Epiſtles, which he wrote vnto him,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.5.</note> to continue to doe the worke of an Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. Theſe likewiſe had their time, and are no more in vſe at this preſent.</p>
               <p>Paſtors are they,<note place="margin">Paſtors.</note> that haue the charge of ſome certaine flockes, and of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churches, to rule and gouerne the ſame, preaching the Goſpell, adminiſtring the ſacramentes, and exerciſing diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in thoſe Churches. This degree and office, muſt haue his courſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church, euen vntill the end

of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Doctors.</note>Doctors are they, which the Church in olde time called Catechiſers, that is to ſay, inſtructors or teachers, whoſe charge and office was, plainely and ſimplie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſcriptures, that men might haue the right ſenſe and vnderſtanding thereof, and namely to teach the <hi>Catechumini,</hi> that is to ſay, thoſe that were yet to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in the pointes and principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion. Of this ſort are the Doctors and teachers of our age, which teach youth in ſchooles, expounding vnto them the ſcripture. And their office conſiſteth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, carefully to prouide that ſound doctrine may be kept &amp; publiſhed, to the end that pure religion may continue and remaine in the Church. Some ſuppoſe that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Paſtor &amp; Doctor is all one, as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome and S. Auguſtine: yet there is no dout, but that they are two diſtinct offices, which men may not confound and mingle together. For albeit that this be the charge and office of al Paſtors, to teach, yet they go ſomewhat further than the Doctors do. For firſt and formoſt, they preach and exhort, applying the doctrine to the neceſſities of the Church: next they adminiſter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25134:83"/>
and in the third place, they haue the charge, gouernement, and execution of the diſcipline: to which matters, the Doctors charge reacheth not, they being only ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to expound the ſcriptures, to the end that pure and ſound doctrine may alwaies be preſerued &amp; maintained in the Church. And indeed ſuch a one may be verie apt to execute the office of the Doctor, as hath not the gift to preach: &amp; ſuch a one on the other ſide may very well haue the gift to preach, as ſhall not at any hand be meete or fit, to exerciſe the charge and office of the Doctor, although that ſometimes he that ſhall be the Paſtor, may alſo well be the Doctor: but yet this is to be marked, that they are diuers and ſeuerall charges or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>And theſe be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiue degrees or orders of miniſters, to whome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the gouernement of his Church, to feede the ſame: of which fiue the laſt two onely remaine to be alwayes vſed in his Church. Saint Paule indeede maketh mention in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of ſome other names,<note place="margin">Biſhops and Elders, or Auncients.</note> as of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that is to ſay, watchmen, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchers: and of Elders, that is to ſay, Senators or Ancients: but theſe two names
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:25134:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſignifie one and the ſelfe ſame thing, as the Apoſtle him ſelfe declareth,<note place="margin">Titus 1.5.</note> writing to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. For marke what he ſaith: <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creete, that thou ſhouldest conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to redreſſe the things that remaine, &amp; that thou ſhouldest ordaine Elders, (that is to ſay, Auncients) in euerie citie as I appointed thee.</hi> And afterwardes he addeth an excellent deſcription of true Elders and Auncients. <hi>For a Biſhop</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>must be vnblameable, as the guider or ſteward of Gods owne houſe:</hi> and ſo foorth. We ſee that thoſe whome he named Elders or Auncients, in one verſe, he nameth the ſame Biſhops in an other verſe. Nowe theſe two names of Biſhop and Elder, and the name alſo of Paſtor, are taken in the ſcripture to ſignifie one and the ſelfe ſame eſtate. For the charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Paſtor, is to feede the ſheepe, as appeareth by that which the Lorde ſaith in the foure and thirtie chapter of Ezechiel.<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe be to the ſheepheards of Iſrael, which feed themſelues. Should not the ſheepheards feede the flockes?</hi> But the Biſhops and Elders, are called to the ſame thing,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> as both Saint Paule and Saint Peter doe declare: Saint Paule ſpeaking thus: <hi>Take heede to your ſelues, and to the whole flocke, ouer which the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:25134:84"/>
holie Ghost hath made you Biſhoppes or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, to feede the Churche of GOD, which he hath redeemed with his owne bloud.</hi> And Saint Peter thus:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>The Elders which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest you I beſeech, which am alſo an Elder with you, Feede the flocke of Christ, which is committed vnto you, caring for it, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If one would knowe the reaſon why the Paſtours are called Elders or Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: it is for honours ſake: not as though when in olde time they choſe Paſtours, they were all auncient in age and yeares, but bicauſe that they ſpecially choſe them, from amongeſt the Auncients, and alſo bicauſe they ought to be men both ripe, wiſe, and alſo verie well experienced. Olde age commonly hath more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, more experience and grauitie: But yet it doth not alwayes fall out, that white or grey haire maketh men wiſe: yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſhall finde yong men, which are farre more fit, to exerciſe and execute the charge and office of a Paſtour, (ſuch a one was Timothie) than thoſe that be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeares.</p>
               <p>It is true, that there are two ſorts of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that is to ſay, Ancients. One ſort haue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25134:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
charge and office, to miniſter the worde of GOD and ſacraments, and to watch ouer the diſcipline and ouer the whole Church. The other are ioyned vnto theſe, to ayde them in the exerciſing and execution of diſcipline, without medling any whit at all in the preaching &amp;c. Saint Paule ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out this order when he ſaith to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Elders that rule well, are worthie of double honour, ſpecially they which labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> For in that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of bearing rule, he giueth vs well to vnderſtand, that thoſe whome he nameth Elders or Auncients, that is to ſay, the Paſtours, and ſuch as are ioyned vnto them, are choſen to haue charge and office in the Church, ouer the people. And in that he more commendeth thoſe, which miniſter the word and doctrine, than the other, he euidently declareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al haue not one and the ſelfe ſame charge. We may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this order, euen at this day obſerued in the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deacons.</note>The Apoſtle maketh mention likewiſe of Deacons, which word is taken in holie ſcripture in two ſenſes or ſortes. Somtimes generally for euerie miniſter, or ſeruitour: In which ſenſe S. Paule calleth the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,

the Deacon of God, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4. Ephe. 3.7.

Wherefore being ſo taken, and referred to the eſtate &amp; calling of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, it is commonly tranſlated and turned by this worde, miniſter or ſeruaunt,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1.7. 1. Cor. 3.5.</note> as in the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, and the third Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians.

               <p>The firſt occaſion that was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to choſe theſe deacons in the Church was this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, could not verie wel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for our furniſhe both the charge of preaching the worde, and of diſtributing the goods of the poore. And for this cauſe were the ſeuen Deacons choſen:<note place="margin">Actes. 6.2.</note> of whom is ſpoken. Actes 6. And the conditions and qualities, which ought to bee in the Deacons that men will choſe, are there deſcribed and ſet out, and alſo in the third chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to Timothie.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:25134:86"/>Theſe are the degrees of the Church, or eccleſiaſtical orders, which Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe ſette vp, and his Apoſtles after him eſtabliſhed, for the regiment and gouernment of the Church: which order was afterwardes in the Popedome by litle and litle, not onely corrupted, but vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrown. For in that tyrannous king dome, after that corruption had once craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie ouertaken or ſtolne vppon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, they diuiſed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a ſtewardſhippe, diſpenſation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of eccleſiaſticall offices and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which was altogether farre of and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraunged, from the former ſimplicitie &amp; plainenes, whereof we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>As concerning <hi>Chaplaines,</hi> Durandus in his booke called <hi>Rationale diuinorum offic.</hi> alleageth two reaſons, to ſhew why prieſts were ſo called. The one is, becauſe the kings of France in time heretofore, when they went to warre, were wont to carrie
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25134:87"/>
with them, Saint Martins capp or hoode, which they kepte vnder a tent, which of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cap kept in it was named <hi>Capella,</hi> that is, Chappel: and the Clerkes or Prieſtes, that had the keeping of this Chappel, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chaplaines,</hi> and afterwardes in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time, this name was in ſome countries giuen generally to all Prieſtes. And theſe litle Cabbines, or corners, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high places, which were in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe Temples, wherein the Chaplaines ſaide their maſſes, were called Chappels. The other reaſon is, that when in old time they were to ſet out an armie, or to doe ſome exploite by ſouldiers, they had in the Campe certaine ſpeciall tentes, to ſay maſſe in, which tentes were couered ouer with goates ſkines. Nowe a Goate in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is called <hi>Capra</hi> or <hi>Capella,</hi> that is to ſay, according to the portuiſe of the Prieſtes, which are at this day, Chappel. Wherefore becauſe theſe tentes were couered with goates ſkinnes, they were named Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles, and the Prieſtes which had the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them, and who did therein ſinge their maſſes were called Chaplaines. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold verilie two reaſons, to ſhewe from whence this name Chaplaine is taken,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25134:88"/>
which reaſons are verie high, and full of great ſpeculation or inſight, conteining ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great myſteries, and ſuch as are maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly deepe: but we leaue them to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate or looked into diligently, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes which are the Popes Chaplaines, to the ende that they ſhoulde aduiſe &amp; take counſell, to ſee whether they can bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that their reuerende name ſhould be fet and drawen, from the baſe beginnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Curates.</note>
                  <hi>Curates</hi> haue an other fountaine. In olde time according to the order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Ieſus Chriſt, the paſtors were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and placed diſtinctly and without confuſion in ſeuerall Churches. For to the ende that euerie paſtor might knowe his owne charge, and be able to yeelde a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of his flocke, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one ſhould not any whit at all incroch vpon, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with others, alſo to the ende, that the flocke &amp; ſheepe might know, where they might ſeeke for and finde their owne paſtors, they deuided the people into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circuites and countries or rather pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes indeede, whereof ſome were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the charge of certaine paſtors, &amp; otherſome to the charge of certaine other paſtors. From thence came the name Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25134:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
although ſome would haue it deriued from <hi>Cura,</hi> that is to ſay, from the care that the paſtors ought to haue ouer their flocks which were giuen &amp; committed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in charge. And the abuſe comming on, &amp; growing vp more and more, they called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefice or renewe, that was aſſigned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maintaine themſelues vpon for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their office, by the name of cure.

Biſhop of Rome was helde and taken for the principall &amp; chiefe of Biſhops, bicauſe he was in the principal citie of the Empire: ſo the Prieſtes (as they call them) and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of that citie, were helde and taken for Cardinals, that is to ſay, for principall and chiefe among other Prieſtes and Deacons. Wherevpon he addeth ſome examples. There is a certaine epiſtle (ſaith he) of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the firſt, to them of Peloponezus, who demaunded a Prieſt to miniſter the ſacraments vnto them, wherein he ſaith, we ſend vnto you our beloued ſonne, A prieſt Cardinal. Alſo: there is amongſt the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charters, in the Church of Aretinum, a donation or gift, of a certaine Romane Senator named Zenobius, which was made vnto the ſaide Church, in the time of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus the high Biſhop, wherein there is contained this ſubſcription: <hi>And I, Io.

               <p>If the Cardinals of theſe dayes, would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:25134:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take their beginning from theſe, let them marke then, what is their charge and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without taking that vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which belongeth not vnto them. But we knowe, what great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there is betwene their eſtate &amp; theſe, bicauſe at this day we may in euerie place behold it to be an eſtate or calling of honor, &amp; not of office &amp; charge, as it was then. Beſide, when was it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ſo lifted vp? and by whom? A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares and more were ſpent, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church was burdened with ſuch Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, as we haue at this day, hauing bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, without exerciſing or executing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is affirmed, that Pope Innocentius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name, about the yeare of Chriſt 1244. did ſo exalt their eſtate and calling, that he commaunded by Edict, that from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time foreward, they ſhould goe on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and ſhould weare a red cap or hat, &amp; a ſcarlet robe, for a ſigne and witneſſe that they ought to be always readie and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuffer and ſhead their bloud, for the defence of Chriſtian religion. And Paule the ſecond, about the yeare 1470. hath rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſame Edict, and in ſome point aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and inlarged it.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſet vp him ſelfe and ſay,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:25134:91"/>
that theſe Prieſtes and Deacons of Rome, which were called Cardinals, obtained that name, bicauſe at that time they were ſuch, as the Cardinals at this preſent are, that is to ſay, hauing authoritie and iuriſdiction, ouer all other Biſhops and Prieſtes: I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe goeth not ſo. For we find this, that the Prieſts and Deacons of Rome were in times paſt much leſſe and inferior to the Biſhops, in ſteede whereof at this day, they goe before them in honour and dignitie. And that ſo it is, we read that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Biſhop of Rome, ſent two Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors or Legates to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councel of Carthage, whereof one was a Prieſt of the Church of Rome, he was ſet the laſt of all.

               <p>Touching <hi>the foure Patriarches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Patriarches.</note> we haue ſpoken thereof in the beginning of the 7. Chapter.

of Conſtantinople, wherein mention is made of Metropolitanes. Theſe <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> then or <hi>Metropolitanes,</hi> being lifted vp in degree of honour, aboue all the reſt of the Biſhops, &amp; in proceſſe of time thruſt on foreward with ambition, haue ſo incro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched one of them vpon an other, that at the laſt they haue brought all the Patriarches, euen to the number of foure, as we haue named and deſcribed them in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſeuenth Chapter. And this hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally come to paſſe, bicauſe, that either for the antiquitie of the Churches, or for the renoune of the cities, and excellencie alſo of the Biſhops, men haue reuerenced and honoured <hi>Rome, Constantinople, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> aboue all other cities: and by conſequent the Biſhops of thoſe places, as thoſe that were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall or chiefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope.</note>Nowe theſe foure Patriarches, haue yet in ſuch ſort ſo robbed one an other, that the Patriarch of Rome, and he of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, haue quite and cleane taken away the roome and place of the other two. And as touching the two of Rome and Conſtantinople, we knowe what iarre and contention there hath bene betwixt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25134:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, which is not as yet well compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or ended. In the time of Gregorie the firſte of that name, about the yeare ſixe hundred and two, there was great controuerſie and ſtirre for the primacie of the Church. For Iohn Biſhoppe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, was declared and publiſhed in a ful and ſolemne Synode of the Grecians, vniuerſall Patriarch, and the Emperour Mauritius commaunded Gregorie, to obey the ſaid Patriarch of Conſtantinople. But Gregorie would not indure or ſuffer this preſumption, that any Biſhop ſhould be an vniuerſall Biſhop ouer all the reſt: and in his Epiſtles he yealdeth reaſons thereof. Firſt he ſaith:<note place="margin">Greg. lib. 6. epiſt. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>If he fall that is called the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Biſhoppe, the whole Church falleth from her estate.</hi> Secondly: <hi>None of my predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors hath euer deſired to haue or vſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane worde. For if there be one Patriarch that is called vniuerſall, the name of Patriarch ſhall be taken from all the rest. To conſent to this execrable and accurſed name, is no other thing, but to betraye the faith, and to deſtroy Christianitie.</hi> Thirdly:<note place="margin">Greg. lib. 7. epiſt. 196.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſpeake freely and boldly, that who ſo euer calleth him ſelfe vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Biſhoppe, or deſireth to be called by that name, the ſame is in his pride the forerunner
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:25134:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Antichrist, bicauſe that by his pride he preferreth him ſelfe before all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This controuerſie being betweene theſe two Patriarches of Rome and of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, it fell out and was agreed, that the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted head of the Churches of the Eaſt, and the Patriarch of Rome head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches of the Weſt: and this latter was afterward ſo eſtabliſhed, and lifted vp by Phocas, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare 604. (as we haue declared in the ſeuenth Chapter) that he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope and vniuerſall Biſhoppe of all Churches.</p>
               <p>And as touching the name Pope, it hath bene heretofore generally attributed and giuen to all Biſhops, as may be proued by theſe teſtimonies. Aurelius Biſhop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, is called by this name Pope, in the beginning of the Councel holden at the ſaide Carthage: of which Councel he was Preſident. In the hundreth fiftie and one Chapter of the ſame Councel, Innocentius Biſhop of Alexandria, is called Pope. Saint Cyprian in certaine Epiſtles which he writ to the ſame Biſhop, calleth him Pope. The Elders and Deacons of Rome,<note place="margin">Cyprian li. 2 Epiſt. 7.</note> called Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian Pope in their Epiſtles. Saint Ierome
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:25134:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
oftentimes calleth Auguſtine Pope, in his epiſtles Dionyſius Biſhop of Alexandria in the third Epiſtle to Philemon, calleth He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclas his predeceſſor, Pope, as we may ſee in Euſebius his ſeuenth booke,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 7. cap. 7.</note> &amp; ſeuenth Chapter. There may be many ſuch like te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies founde, which declare that the name Pope, was in auncient time commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all Biſhoppes. If the queſtion be, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſignification of the name, Suidas ſaith, that it ſignifieth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> language of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe, as much as father. But we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed and diſcourſed heretofore, largely inough of this primacie.</p>
               <p>Now let vs returne to our firſt purpoſe &amp; ſpeach, who is he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath ordeined theſe orders and eccleſiaſticall degrees? by what dore haue theſe paſtors entered, into the Lordes ſheepefolde? who hath called and placed them in their charges? was Ieſus Chriſt (who is the chiefe ſheepeherde, the Prince of Prophetes, the wiſedome of the father) ſo ill aduiſed, or ſo careleſſe that he hath not placed ſo many degrees and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Church, as hee ſawe and knewe to be needefull, for the rule and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, ſeeing hee loued it ſo much, and eſteemed it ſo deare and precious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

him ſelfe, that he deliuered him ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt cruel &amp; moſt ſhamefull death of all others, to ſaue it?

                  <hi>That Ieſus Chriſte hath giuen Apostles,

               </p>
               <p>Nowe according to this rule, can the Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, &amp; other prieſts of the Romiſh Church ſay: that they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie themſelues in their charges, to feede the flocke of Chriſte, to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to adminiſter the ſacramentes, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſaintes, to giue ouer themſelues wholy to the worke of the miniſterie, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the Church?

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:25134:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Canons, which they attribute to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (of which wee ſpake in the fifth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) were well and rightly obſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, as they ſay they ſhould be indeede?</p>
               <p>But behold their vngodlineſſe, they ſay that they exerciſe and execute their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide offices and charges by their vicars &amp; deputies, whome they haue ſubſtituted and appointed vnder them in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ouer their Pariſhioners. Yea but when Ieſus Chriſt called and ſent foorth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, did he ſay vnto them, goe and be the paſtors of my Church, teaching it and feeding, by Vicars ſubſtitutes and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes, which ye ſhall put in your places? It is certaine that hee did not ſo, but hee gaue vnto them in their owne perſons, the ſpeciall charge of his Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in plaine &amp; expreſſe termes, to preach the Goſpell themſelues, and to adminiſter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacraments. Moreouer what ſufficient vicars or deputies are they wont to haue, and how faithful, meet and able to doe the duetie of Paſtors? Such Biſhoppes and perſons, ſuch Vicars and Liuetenants, that is to ſay, one of them as ignoraunt, fooliſh and vnskilful as the other. But why
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25134:96"/>
doe they take vppon them the name and charge of an office, which they will not exerciſe and execute? why take they y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hire wages and reuenue of that labor &amp; worke, which at no hand they doe, neither indeed will doe? For they haue no care to haue vicars and Lieutenauntes, but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may enioy prebendes, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes of their benefices, and yet they wil ſeeme to haue them, as though it were to do their dueties.</p>
               <p>Yea which is more then this, they make accurſed and more then profane diuiſion of their offices, betweene them and their Friers, vilanouſly ſeparating that which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ioyned together: For to whome was it, that Ieſus Chriſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the office to miniſter the ſacramentes, but euen to them themſelues, and to them alone alſo, whome he enioyned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to preach the Goſpell? But theſe men, to wit, the Biſhops, parſons, &amp; other Prieſtes, doe reſerue vnto themſelues the adminiſtration of the ſacramentes, ſuch as they haue, with the rentes and reuenewes of their biſhoppricks, parſonages, &amp; other benefices, and poſt ouer the charge &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of preaching the worde to the Friers,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25134:96"/>
leauing them the bagge, wallet, and ſtaffe, whatſoeuer by begging they can get for their hire or wages. But ſeeing that they leaue vnto the friers y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of preaching, why do they not leaue vnto them alſo the office and charge to adminiſter the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? For theſe two offices are ioyned together, and may not at any hand be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or ſundred one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from an other. Notwithſtanding, there is in the Popedom a plaine prohibition and forbidding, that friers, in as much as they are friers, ſhould meddle with or take vpon them to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter any ſacrament, except they bee ſuch as haue charge, or vnleſſe they be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with all for the doing of it. But why then are they ſuffered to preach? For this is to doe againſt the ordinaunce and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, and to diuide and ſunder things, which he hath ioyned together. Or ſeeing, that they are come ſo farre, as to forbid friers to adminiſter the ſacraments, why doe they ſuffer them to ſay maſſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they all hold and affirme, that the maſſe, is the ſacrament of the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which for this cauſe alſo they cal, <hi>The ſacrament of the alter.</hi>

Nowe of theſe three cauſes or meanes we are not to deſpiſe any one, ſeeing that GOD by them, will accompliſh and bring to paſſe, his owne worke in vs. Wherefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the proper and peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the holie ſpirit, to lighten vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to lead vs to the knowledge of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25134:98"/>
truth, yet ſo it is notwithſtanding, that the outward miniſterie of the word is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, bicauſe that God vſeth the ſame as an inferior or ſecondarie meane, for the aboue named effect and purpoſe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the preaching of the word, and the adminiſtration of ſacramentes, doe then ſhewe and bring forth their effect and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt ioyneth his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by the which only the eares are perced, the harts opened, the affections touched, &amp; the wils diſpoſed and prepared, thereby to giue an entrance to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward miniſterie: inſomuch that if this inward maſter or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher doe faile vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward miniſterie can no more profit our ſoules, than the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſunne helpeth blind eies, or than a voice which ſoundeth lowd, profiteth deaf eares. In the meane while, the outward miniſterie is not vnprofitable or vaine, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the holy Ghoſt is ioyned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, working within, but is full of vertue, efficacie &amp; power, euen as it pleaſeth God to bleſſe it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is. Thoſe which knowe all things, and haue not neede that any ſhould teach them, haue nothing to do with the outward miniſterie: but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:25134:98"/>
knowe al thinges (as S. Iohn ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.20.27.</note>) and haue no neede that any ſhould teach them. It foloweth then, that the faithful haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the outward miniſterie.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that the place of S. Iohn, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yll and peruerſly applied. For when he ſaith, <hi>that the faithfull</hi> (to whome he writ) <hi>knewe all things,</hi> firſt that this ought to be referred to that which he had before ſaide,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.14.</note> in the 14. verſe, to wit, <hi>that they knewe the father,</hi> (for he that knoweth the father, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely knoweth all, bicauſe the father is knowne in his ſonne) <hi>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.3.</note> as ſaith Saint Paule. And therefore alſo the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declareth to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>that he esteemed not to knowe any thing among them, ſaue Ieſus Christ and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly when he ſaith, <hi>that they knowe all things,</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were not yong ſchollers, rude, and ignorant, but expert &amp; well skilled in the matters, which he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded &amp; ſet forth vnto them: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therfore he did not ſet out theſe pointes to them, as though they were altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he did onely bring theſe things to their mindes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them. As S. Peter writeth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:25134:99"/>
faithfull.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not be negligent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to put you alwayes in remembrance of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, though that ye haue knowledge, and be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the preſent truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, when he ſaith, <hi>that they had no neede that any ſhould teach them,</hi> this ought not to be read alone by it ſelfe, but ought to be ioyned with that which followeth, to wit,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.27.</note> 
                  <hi>but as the ſame annoynting teacheth you of all things, and it is true, and is not lying:</hi> As if he would ſay: you haue bene taught of the holie Ghoſt, who is alwayes true, and no maner of way a lyar. You then haue not neede, that any ſhould teach you ſome other matter, as they are wont to do which teach for doctrine mans inuentions, but if any do teach you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he follow that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holie Ghoſt hath taught you, in whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it behoueth you alwayes to abide.</p>
               <p>The third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: The Lord ſaith thus. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more euery man his neighbour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 31.34.</note> 
                  <hi>and euery man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me, from the least of them vnto the greateſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> This promiſe muſt be referred to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of the Church vnder the new Teſtament: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that the miniſterie of the worde, ought not any more to haue place
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25134:99"/>
now in the Church. I anſwere, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the place of Ieremie, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrarie to the meaning, intent, and purpoſe of the holie Ghoſt. For firſt &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord making compariſon betwene the old people and the newe, meaneth not any other thing, but that vnder the Goſpel he would ſend vnto his people ſo great a light, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, that his knowledge ſhould be common &amp; familiar to all, whereas vnder the lawe, he manifeſted &amp; declared him ſelfe darkly, &amp; that vnder certaine ſhadowes &amp; figures. As indeed the ancient people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, they which were in the time of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not ſo familiarly, plainely, and perfectly taught, as we be at this day, by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon whereof alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Malachie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>the ſonne of righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malach. 4.2.</note> ſignifying therby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fathers vnder the law, had indeed ſom light, but yet not ſuch a light as we, through his goodnes haue at this day. Furthermore we muſt marke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord doth not ſay ſimplie: <hi>They ſhall teach no more euery man his neighbor, &amp; euery man his brother,</hi> but he addeth, ſaying: <hi>Know the Lord.</hi> By which reſtriction, or ſtrayning it into a narrow roome, he plainly declareth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25134:100"/>
that he promiſeth to his children ſuch a knowledge, that they ſhal not be any more learners of the A.B.C. neither young ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the doctrine of ſaluation. For theſe words, <hi>Know the Lord,</hi> denote &amp; point out the firſt rudiments or inſtructions of faith, and of the heauenly doctrine. And indeed, if we wel weigh &amp; mark, how rude, groſſe and ignorant, the old fathers were, we ſhall finde that they were as it were, little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.1. &amp;c.</note> euen as Saint Paule ſaith, and as yet in their A.B.C. But God hath ſhewed vnto vs, a farre greater grace, bicauſe that we haue a more manifeſt, cleare, and ſhining light, to leade vs to the knowledge of God, and of the myſteries of our ſaluation. For this cauſe Ieſus Chriſt ſaide:<note place="margin">Matth. 13.16.17. Luk. 20.23.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee, and your eares for they heare. For verily I ſay vnto you, that many Kinges, Prophetes, and righteous men, haue deſired to ſee thoſe thinges which ye ſee, and haue not ſeene them: and to heare thoſe thinges which you heare, &amp; haue not heard them.</hi> In ſumme the Lorde promiſeth here, that his people ſhal not be found, groſſe and ignorant, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the newe couenant or teſtament, that they ſhall haue neede of the principles and beginnings of Chriſtian doctrine. But if we
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:25134:100"/>
would not take this place in this ſenſe, how ſhal we expound an other of Iſaiah,<note place="margin">Iſai. 2.2.3.</note> which ſeemeth to be contrarie to this? He ſaith: <hi>It ſhall be in the laſt dayes, that the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be prepared in the toppe of the mountaines, and ſhall be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the hilles, and all nations ſhall flowe vnto it, and many people ſhall goe and ſay, Come, and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lorde, to the houſe of the God of Iaacob, &amp; he will teach vs his wayes.</hi> It is certaine that he propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euen as Ieremiah, of the grace of God, which ſhould be made manifeſt through Ieſus Chriſte in the time of the Goſpell. Nowe one of them ſaith: <hi>Euerie one ſhall not teach his neighbour, for they ſhall all knowe the Lord:</hi> The other ſaith: <hi>The people ſhall runne together and ſay: Come, Let vs goe vp to the mountaines of the Lord, and he ſhall teach vs his wayes.</hi> How ſhall we make theſe two places agree, ſeeing that both of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of one and the ſelfe ſame thing? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Ieremiah meaneth, that the people of God ſhalbe in ſuch ſort lightened vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Teſtament, by the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal haue no more neede of the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or firſt inſtructions of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither to be ſo taught as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde people were, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:25134:101"/>
ſhadowes &amp; ceremonies of the law. And as touching Iſaiah, he meaneth that vnder the ſame newe Teſtament, the people ſhal (though they be wel aduanced and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the points of chriſtian doctrine) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding diligently indeuour, more &amp; more to aduance them ſelues, &amp; grow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward therin, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe, they ſhall continually exhort one an other, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end they may better profite in the knowledge of the lawe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ioel. 2.28.49.</note>The fourth argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It is written in Ioel: <hi>At that time,</hi> (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Teſtament) <hi>I will poure out my ſpirit vpon all fleſh, ſaith the Lorde, and your ſonnes and your daughters ſhall prophecie, your olde men ſhall dreame dreames, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions: And alſo at that time I will poure out my ſpirit vpon the ſeruants, &amp; vpon the maids.</hi> Nowe by this promiſe, the charge &amp; office to teach, is without any difference laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, vpon fathers &amp; children, vpon ſonnes &amp; vpon daughters, vpon olde folke, and vpon yong, vpon ſeruants and maides: wherefore it followeth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie of the word, is not neceſſarie in the Church.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere, that there is nothing in this argument or reaſon, but a meere cauil. It is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:25134:101"/>
true, that this prophecie ought to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the kingdome &amp; comming of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gift of prophecying ſhould then be common, both to men &amp; women, to old and yong &amp; to be ſhort to all eſtats. But in the firſt place this is to be marked, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prophet ſpeaketh here by compariſon, vſing a figure commonly called <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> that is to ſay, a maner of ſpeach very exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, becauſe of our weariſomnes, ſlacknes and negligence, for hee doth not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe, that all vnder the Goſpell, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt to the laſt, ſhall bee partakers of this gifte, but in reſpecte of the olde peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder the lawe. For if wee compare, the eſtate &amp; condition of the old Church, with the ſingular treaſures, which God hath powred out, and giuen vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after the manifeſtation and reuealing of Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhall finde, that in this latter time, the Lorde hath ſpread abroad, and powred out the giftes of his ſpirite v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all fleſhe, that is to ſay, almoſt vpon all men, when as vnder the lawe, a verie ſmal number was partakers therof. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſaith, <hi>That the Lord will powre out his ſpirite vpon all fleſhe,</hi> this particle or worde <hi>all,</hi> is not here taken in his proper
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:25134:102"/>
ſignification, as though it were ſimply and altogether vniuerſall, but is indefinite, and muſt be referred to all eſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people, and not to euerie ſingular perſon: as in this ſentence of S. Paul, where it is ſaide:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>that God will haue all men to bee ſaued,</hi> that is to ſay, all perſons, of what qualitie, &amp; condition ſoeuer they be. And in that place of Saint Matthewe,<note place="margin">Matt. 4.23.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>that Ieſus Christ being in Galilee healed all ſickeneſſe, and all diſeaſe among the people:</hi> That is to ſay, all ſortes of ſickeneſſes and diſeaſes. And indeed S. Peter, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Chapter of the Actes,<note place="margin">Act. 2.16.17</note> maketh this ſenſe manifeſt and plaine vnto vs, when he ſaith, <hi>that this prophecie was then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed when Ieſus Chriſt ſent his holy ſpirite, vpon the Apoſtles.</hi> Nowe we knowe that all fleſhe, that is to ſay all men, were not at that time indewed, with the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</p>
               <p>Secondly. The Prophet ſpeaketh not here, of the publike office and charge to teach, but of the particular duetie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, calling them generally Prophetes, who in the time of the Goſpell ſhould be indewed, with ſo great light of doctrine, that they might after a ſort bee compared
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:25134:102"/>
with the auncient prophetes.<note place="margin">Iere. 31.34.</note> Wherevnto alſo muſt be referred the place of Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,<note place="margin">Mala. 4.2. Matt. 13.16.17.</note> which wee haue expounded in the former argument, and likewiſe the place of Malachie and of Ieſus Chriſte in the 13. of Saint Matthewe. It is not then without cauſe, that Ioel attributeth, this title or name of prophete, to them, who haue no publike charge or office to teach, but are onely inlightened by the holye ſpirite, and the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.11</note> becauſe that this light is farre more excellent, then the gift of Prophecie it ſelf was in diuers who liued vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law. And alſo though we are bounde, to exhort one an other, and to teach one an other in the doctrine of godlines, and the feare of God, yet for al that the publike miniſterie of the worde, is not ſuperfluous or vaine in the Church. For the ſelfe ſame God, that hath commanded fathers, to inſtruct their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all vs to admoniſh one an other, hath alſo ordeined the publike miniſterie of the word in the Church, that it may be there practiſed and exerciſed, not for ſome fewe yeares onely, but euen vnto the ende of the world.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:25134:103"/>
of the aduerſaries and ſuch as ſet them ſelues againſt the miniſterie of the Church. Now let vs bring foorth our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to proue the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is: Ieſus Chriſte hath commaunded that the Goſpell ſhould bee preached, and the ſacraments adminiſtred in the Church vnto the ende of the world. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the miniſtery is alwaies requiſite and neceſſarie in the Church. I proue the Antecedent or former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe wordes of Chriſt, written in the laſt Chapter of Saint Matthew:<note place="margin">Matt. 28.19.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe &amp; teach all nations, baptiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerue whatſoeuer I haue commanded you, and beholde I am with you vnto the worldes ende.</hi> For after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to preach the worde and to adminiſter baptiſme (vnder which ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other alſo of the holy ſupper is conteined) becauſe the diſciples might doubt or feare their charge, as being great in labour, and harde to execute, Ieſus Chriſt addeth a promiſe of his aſſiſtaunce not for tenne or twentie yeares onely, but for alwayes, euen vnto the ende of the worlde. Wherein hee manifeſtly ſetteth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:25134:103"/>
out and declareth two thinges. One, that he willeth and ordeineth, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie be exerciſed in the Church, not for one age onely, but continually vnto the conſummation and ende of all things. The other is, that he promiſeth, that although Sathan ſubtillie deuiſe and inuent and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee can, to hinder the miniſterie &amp; the work of Gods ſeruants, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyrants by their practiſes and violences, inforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, to the vttermoſt of their power, to ouerthrowe, and to bring to naught the Church of God, yet hee will by his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heauenly power, alwaies mayntein his trueth in the worlde, and preſerue his Church therein by the miniſterie &amp; labor of his faithfull paſtors.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> The Apoſtle Saint Paul ſaith to the Romanes, <hi>That faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing, and hearing by the worde of God.</hi> Whereby he declareth, that God hath accuſtomed to plant faith in our harts by the preaching of his word. It is true, that the power of God is not tyed to this outward meane, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is able to beget faith in vs after ſome other faſhion, and by ſome other meane (although it be to vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible) euen as it ſhal pleaſe him
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:25134:104"/>
ſelfe: but notwithſtanding all this, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of his worde, is the ordinarie meane, which hee vſeth or ſerueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with, to giue vs faith by, ſo that they which will haue faith, wirhout the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and hearing of the worde, doe as much as though they woulde liue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meates and drinkes which GOD hath ordeyned for our bodily life. Nowe herevpon we take and frame our argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thus.</p>
               <p>Faith is in all times, and alwayes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for men.</p>
               <p>But faith is giuen vnto men from God, by the miniſterie of the worde.</p>
               <p>Therefore it followeth, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the worde, is in all times, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neceſſarie for men.</p>
               <p>The thirde reaſon: It is certaine, that for as much as the ſacramentes are ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, to be as it were ſeales of the worde, to ſeale in our heartes that which is therein conteyned alreadie, that is to ſay the vnion, fellowſhippe, and partaking, which we haue in Ieſus Chriſt, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that where there is not the worde of God preached, there wee cannot haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For as a ſeale is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:25134:104"/>
yea is not allowed a ſeale, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be bound or ſet to ſome inſtrument or writing, for the confirmation thereof: euen ſo the ſacrament is altogether vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, yea indeed is not a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if it be not ioyned with the worde of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, to confirme the ſame vnto vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon S. Auguſtine hath ſometimes ſaide: <hi>Let the worde be ioyned to the ſacrament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augu. ſup. Iohan. hom. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; there ſhall be made a ſacrament.</hi> Of what worde ſpeaketh he? verily not of a worde mumbled vp, murmured or whiſpered without vnderſtanding ouer the elements, but of the worde of God preached to the faithful, and receiued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through faith, as he himſelf maketh it plaine, when ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of baptiſme, he addeth, <hi>this is the word of faith which we preach, by which baptiſme is conſecrated and hallowed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.21</note> 
                  <hi>to haue power to make cleane.</hi> Nowe from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is aboue ſaide, we reaſon after this manner.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtration of the holy ſupper, is alwayes neceſſarie in the Church, euen vnto the end of the world, for Ieſus Chriſt hath commaunded vs to celebrate it, &amp; by that meanes to preach or ſhewe foorth his death vntill his comming againe.</p>
               <p>But the adminiſtration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:25134:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be performed without the miniſterie of the worde.</p>
               <p>Therefore it followeth, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the worde, is alwayes neceſſarie in the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: Ieſus Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and eſtabliſhed the miniſters of the worde,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.11.</note> for the worke of the miniſterie, till wee all meete together (in the vnitie of faith and knowledge of the ſon of God) vnto a perfecte man, and vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt, that is to ſay, till that Chriſt bee perfect in vs, and haue in vs his ful grouth and increaſe. But wee can not obtaine ſuch perfection vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.9.10.</note> at what time God ſhall be all in all.

               <p>Theſe reaſons are ſufficient for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to teach and proue that the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, is continually requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie

in the Church: as indeede, the Lorde hath for our good &amp; ſaluation eſtabliſhed the ſame, to abide in al ages, therein apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and framing him ſelfe, to our weaknes, which is ſo great (we being corrupted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſinne) that without this means meet and agreeable to our nature, we could not be well inſtructed in the pointes of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. For if God ſhould ſpeake vnto vs in his maieſtie, we could not at any hande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with or abide his preſence, as we may ſee it, by thoſe, that when he was minded to publiſh and to giue his lawe, the people the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues being aſtoniſhed,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.19. Deut. 5.28.29.</note> with his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; maieſtie, ſaid vnto Moſes, <hi>Talke thou with vs, and we wil heare. But let not the Lord talke with vs, leſt we dy:</hi> And God accepting this their requeſt, ſaide vnto Moſes, <hi>I haue heard the wordes of the voice of this people, which they haue ſpoken vnto thee: they haue wel ſaid, al that they haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Oh that there were ſuch a heart in them to feare me, and to keepe al my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements alway, that it might go well with them, and with their children for euer. Go, ſay vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, returne into your tents, but ſtand thou here with me, and I wil tel thee all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, and the ordinances,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 5.30.31.</note> 
                  <hi>and the lawes, which thou ſhalt teach them, that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:25134:106"/>
they may do them &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore God yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto this people their requeſt, to wit, that they might be taught, by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Moſes. And ſithence that time, it was yet his good pleaſure, to haue continued, and that vnto the end, this manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and teaching his Church, by the miniſterie of men, which order men them ſelues did require and choſe: in ſo much, that when God him ſelfe ſent Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.38. Heb. 2.16.</note> to preach the Goſpell, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, to take vpon him, not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels, but the ſeede of Abraham, that he might be like vnto vs in all things, yet without ſinne. And Chriſt him ſelfe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to heauen,<note place="margin">Act. 14.15.</note> committed vnto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (who were men as we) the office &amp; charge to teach vs. And ſince that time, this order hath continued, and is common and ordinarie in the Church, and can not be ſeparated from the Church, to wit, that God doth teach vs, by the miniſterie of men, as by his inſtruments, which are moſt profitable,<note place="margin">Act. 8.27. &amp;c.</note> familiar and eaſie to vs. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch of Candace Queene of the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, read in his chariot the holie ſcriptures: and no doubt, the Lorde could verie well haue inſtructed him, in the myſteries of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:25134:106"/>
faith, by the ſecrete vertue and power of his holie ſpirit, but yet he delighted rather to haue it done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie of Phillip, &amp; liked better therof.<note place="margin">Act. 10.1.2. &amp;c.</note> Cornelius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, to the end he might be more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the knowledge of the Goſpel, was ſent backe (as it were) from the Angell to Saint Peter: <hi>He ſhall tell thee</hi> (ſaith the Angel) <hi>what thou oughtest to doe.</hi> Yea Saint Paul him ſelfe, although that the Lord had ſpoken vnto him with his owne mouth, was yet notwithſtanding ſent backe (as it were) to Ananias,<note place="margin">Act. 9.3.4. &amp;c.</note> that he might be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and receiue the holie Ghoſt, and be baptiſed. Wherefore they that doe caſt from them, or diſallowe the miniſterie of the Church, hanging vpon, and looking for Angelicall and diuine reuelations, to inſtruct them, doe not onely deceiue them ſelues, but alſo violate and breake the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which GOD hath eſtabliſhed in his Church, for our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now there remaineth, to ſee and know howe much we ought to deferre and giue to the miniſterie, for if they be deceiued which deſpiſe it, and do not their duetie in that behalfe which they ought, they are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:25134:107"/>
deceiued alſo, which attribute or giue ouer much vnto it. Wherefore we ſay, that we ought not to giue to it, either more or leſſe, than that which belongeth thereto, &amp; that as it is good reaſon that the authoritie and credite thereof, ſhould be reſerued vnto it ſelfe ſafe and ſound, ſo we ought to take good heede of this, that we pull not from God the honour which is due vnto him. For this purpoſe and point, we muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerue and marke this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Sometimes man is compared with God, when the miniſter is mentioned or ſpoken of, and then it is ſaide, that he is not able to doe any thing at all, and that his labour or worke is altogether vnprofitable. As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Saint Paul ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Neither is he that planteth, any thing, neither is he that watereth, but God that giueth the increaſe.</hi> For what can man haue in himſelf, if he would enter into this, to part or diuide a matter betwene God &amp; him ſelfe? we muſt therefore take heede of this, not ſo much as once to thinke, that the vertue and power of the holie Ghoſt, ſhould be tied and bound to the miniſterie of men, as though without it God could not worke in mens hearts, euen
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:25134:107"/>
as ſhall pleaſe him ſelfe, as we ſee that they of the Romiſh church ſuppoſe and thinke, as appeareth in this, that they ſpare not to affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if a childe dye without baptiſme adminiſtred by man, it can not be ſaued: &amp; on the other ſide, that they which receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward ſignes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters handes, receiue by and by the grace of God, which is tied to theſe ſignes. But God ſaith by his Prophetes, <hi>That it belongeth to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 31.33. Ezech. 11.19</note> 
                  <hi>to write his lawe in mens harts, to take away from them their ſtonie heartes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 32.40.</note> 
                  <hi>and to giue them heartes of fleſh, to renue within them a newe ſpirite, to put his feare in their heartes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 43.25.</note> 
                  <hi>that they ſhould not depart from him.</hi> Shortly: <hi>That it is he alone, to whome it belongeth to pardon ſinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 5.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and to ſaue.</hi> And we heare that which Saint Paule ſaith, <hi>That it appertaineth to GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>to giue the increaſe to that which the ministers plant and water:</hi> And Ieſus:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.44.65</note> 
                  <hi>That none can come vnto him, except his father drawe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo the ſcripture ſpeaketh of man, without comparing God and him together, and then, in reſpect that God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his miniſterie, to accompliſh his own worke by, that is attributed to him, which is proper and peculiar to God. As when it is ſaide,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.6.</note> that the miniſters <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>builde</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:25134:108"/>

Wherefore God is alwayes the efficient or working cauſe of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and man, together with the worde of GOD, which he propoundeth and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto vs, is nothing elſe, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and miniſter, wherewith GOD ſerueth him ſelfe, or which he vſeth for the performaunce of ſo excellent a worke. Wherevpon it followeth, that they which deſpiſe and reiect the miniſterie which God hath ordained, doe deſpiſe and reiect God him ſelfe.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.16.</note> For this cauſe Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>He that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiſeth you despiſeth me, and he that despiſeth me, despiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> And Saint Paule writing to the Corinthians, declareth right well, in what authoritie, reuerence, and account, we ought to haue
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:25134:108"/>
the miniſterie of the worde, when he ſaith, <hi>That GOD hath committed vnto the Paſtors and ministers of the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>We thanke God without ceaſing, that when ye receiued of vs the worde of the preaching of God, ye receiued it, not as the word of man, but (as it is indeede) the word of God, which alſo worketh in you that beleeue.</hi> It is for the verie ſelfe ſame reaſon, that ſpeaking vnto the Romanes of the worde preached by the miniſters, he ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Gospell is the power of God to ſaluation, to all that beleeue.</hi> And to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>In ſumme, we ought diligently to take heede to,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.9.</note> and to regard that which S. Paule faith vnto the Corinthians: <hi>We together are Gods laborers, ye are Gods huſbandrie, and

Gods building:</hi> in ſo much that we alwayes ſet before vs two things, when the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſpute ſhall be, touching the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: that is to ſay, on the one ſide, the miniſter that ſhall ſpeake and preach vnto vs, and miniſter the ſacrament vnto vs: and on the other ſide God, who worketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in our heartes, and indeede accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth and fulfilleth in vs, that which the miniſter ſpeaketh vnto vs, and doth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly repreſent and ſhewe vnto vs. As we haue a notable example thereof in the ſixteenth of the Actes, where it is ſaid: that <hi>as Saint Paul preached the word of God to Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſeene &amp; heard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that the Church is the companie of faithfull people, which is alſo called the communion or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of the Saintes and holie ones. The
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:25134:109"/>
Churche therefore is holye, becauſe it is compacted or made of ſaintes or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones. but here we muſt marke foure pointes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, howe and in what ſenſe, we are called Saintes or holy ones. It is not as the idiots or ignorant people vnder ſtande it, who by ſaintes, meane none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but thoſe which are alreadie dead, &amp; ſo canoniſed by the Pope, or elſe the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and Friers, clad in white, or blacke, &amp; girded with a rope. But by ſaintes wee vnderſtande them, who being elected from before all euerlaſtingneſſe of time, are in their time (that is to ſay, in the time which God hath appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the worlde were laide) ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by God, through Ieſus Chriſte, and cloathed with true faith. Nowe ſuch are all true Chriſtians and faithfull people.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde: that it is not of our ſelues that we are Saintes, or holy ones,<note place="margin">Pſa. 51.5. &amp;c Gen. 8.21.</note> neither of our owne nature, for by our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all wee are altogether corrupted,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.6. &amp;c.</note> and <hi>the children of wrath.</hi> But we are ſaintes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Ieſus Chriſt hath ſanctified vs,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.3. Iohn. 17.19.</note> as he him ſelfe ſaith in Saint Iohn, <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelfe, that they alſo may be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:25134:110"/>
ſanctified through the trueth.</hi> Nowe he hath ſanctified vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue and power of his holy ſpirite, which by reaſon of this effect is called <hi>the ſpirite of ſanctification.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> And this is that which S. Paul meaneth, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.25.26.27.</note> that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt hath redeemed his Church, and hath ſanctified it, that hee might make it vnto him ſelfe, a glorious Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe this ſanctification or holineſſe, is brought to paſſe, firſt by the imputation or account of Chriſtes righteouſneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> for he was giuen vnto vs by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be our ſanctification. Secondly by the purging or cleanſing of our filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that is to ſay, by the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes in the bloude of Ieſus Chriſte, as Saint Paul declarerh it in the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans when he ſaith, <hi>Bee not deceiued, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fornicators,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.9.10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkardes, nor railers, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, ſhall inherite the kingdome of God, and ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified, but yee are iustified, in the name of the Lorde Ieſus, and by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of our God.</hi> And indeede Saint Paule in an other place ſheweth, that filthineſſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:25134:110"/>
is oppoſed and ſet againſte ſanctification and holineſſe, when hee ſaith to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.19.</note> 
                  <hi>As you haue giuen your members ſeruauntes to vncleaneneſſe and iniquitie, to committe iniquitie: ſo nowe giue your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſeruauntes vnto righteouſneſſe in holines.</hi> Alſo to the Theſſalonians,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>GOD hath not called vs vnto vncleanneſſe, but vnto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirde poynt is, That the holines of the Church is not at any time perfecte, ſo long as ſhee trauelleth and fighteth in this worlde: whiche maior I prooue thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if the Church were without ſpot in this worlde, in vaine hath our Sauiour Chriſte taught it alwayes to pray,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>forgiue vs our trespaſſes, and ſinnes.</hi> But the Lorde Ieſus hath not without good cauſe giuen vs ſuch doctrine and inſtruction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth that the Church, is not in this worlde without ſpotte, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhee hath continuall neede alwayes for to praye vnto GOD, that ſhee may bee more and more ſanctified and obteyne the forgiueneſſe of all her ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe which are with out ſpot
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:25134:111"/>
and wrinckle, haue nothing to doe with any waſhing, becauſe they haue no neede thereof. But the faithfull although they be waſhed, haue notwithſtanding need yet of waſhing ſtill, as Ieſus Chriſte himſelfe declareth it vnto vs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.10.</note> when hee ſaith, <hi>Hee that is waſhed, needeth not ſaue to waſhe his feete.</hi> For by the waſhing of the feete, hee meaneth a continuall ſanctification. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then that the faithful are not in this world without ſpot.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2,</note>Thirdly, Saint Paul ceaſeth not, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orne and bewtifie the Corinthians, with the title of the Church, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greeuouſly abuſed the holy ſupper of the Lorde, and had amongeſt them, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and partakinges, which are not ſmal faultes, yea indeede they were in doubte alſo, touching the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead.

Theſe places doe manifeſtly declare that the Church is neuer ſo pure and perfect in this world, but that it hath always need to be more &amp; more purged &amp;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:25134:111"/>
ſanctified. which thing S. Paul ſheweth yet more plainly, &amp; openly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he writeth vnto the Theſſalonians. For he calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 1.1. 1. Theſ. 5.23</note> and yet he prayeth vnto God for them, <hi>that he would ſanctifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is that the Nouatians, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, and Anabaptiſtes (who doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs, in this point) are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their replies. For firſt, they alledge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that which S. Paul writeth vnto the Epheſians:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.25.26.27.</note> 
                  <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt gaue himſelfe for his Church, that he might ſanctifie it, and cleanſe it, that he might make it vnto himſelfe a glorious Church, not hauing ſpot or wrinckle, but that it ſhoulde be holy &amp; without blame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wee want not an aunſwere alſo. Saint Paul conſidereth the Church not in her ſelfe, but in Ieſus Chriſte her heade, which ſhee taketh holde of by faith: So ſhee is ſaide to bee without wrinckle and vnblameable, by reaſon, not of her owne righteouſneſſe, but of Ieſus Chriſtes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, whereof ſhee is made partaker, becauſe it pleaſed God to impute and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the ſame vnto her: for which cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it is in an other place,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>that Ieſus Chriſte is made of God the father vnto vs, wiſedome,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:25134:112"/>
righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer wee might ſay, that Saint Paul ſpeaketh of ſanctification or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe promiſed, and which is not yet fully accompliſhed, as though he called &amp; ſaide the Church to bee without ſpot, not that it is ſo here belowe on the earth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that one day it ſhall ſo bee aboue in heauen.<note place="margin">Augu. lib. de nuptiis &amp; Concupiſe. cap. 34.</note> And after this ſorte Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine vnderſtandeth it. <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>cleanſeth his Church by the waſhing of Chriſtians, to make it vnto himſelfe, without spott or wrinckle, not in this world, but in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They alledge moreouer that which Saint Iohn ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not.</hi>

               <p>Wherevnto I aunſwere by a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe that are borne of God, that is to ſay the faithfull, ſinne not, that is to ſay, ſerue not ſinne, or rather ſinne doth not raigne in them, becauſe they do withdraw themſelues, as much as they can, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, from ſinne, and with all their heart giue themſelues to holineſſe of life, that they may glorifie God, And in this ſenſe Saint Iohn taketh it and ſpeaketh it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are borne of God, ſinne: that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:25134:112"/>
is to ſay, can not liue ſo holily, but that oftentimes they ſtumble and fall into ſins. For although they be ſanctified, yet for all that, by reaſon of the reliques and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes of nature corrupted, which yet reſteth and remaineth in them, euery day they turne aſide from the righte waye, and ſinne. In this ſenſe S. Iohn ment not that which he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whoſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not, for ſo he ſhould ſpeak againſt him ſelfe, hauing before ſaide, <hi>If we ſay we haue no ſinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.8.10</note> 
                  <hi>wee deceiue our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and trueth is not in vs, yea wee make God a lyer, and his worde is not in vs.</hi> So it is then, that though there ſeeme to bee ſome contrarietie betweene theſe two, to ſay, that we are ſinners, and ſainctes both together, yet all agreeth together ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well for euerie man if we conſider him in his owne nature, according to which he is called the childe of wrath, he is a ſinner worthie of death, and eternall damnation: but if we conſider him in Ieſus Chriſt, as a Chriſtian and faythfull man, hee is holy, ſo that he ſinneth not, that is to ſay, ſerueth not ſinne, and his imperfections are hidden and couered, becauſe that they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, and moreouer the Lorde
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:25134:113"/>
Ieſus maketh him partaker of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And ſo being a ſinner in reſpect of his owne nature, he is notwithſtanding reputed and accounted holy &amp; iuſt before God.</p>
               <p>But that which we haue hitherto ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, toucheth or concerneth the members of the Church particularlie. Wee may alſo well ſay, touching the Church conſidered in her owne bodie, that it ſhall neuer here be purged from al filthineſſes, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo long as ſhee ſhall bee on earth, there ſhall be in her wicked ones mingled with good ones. Which thing Ieſus Chriſt hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Goſpell, by two ſimilitudes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13.24.25. &amp;c.</note>In the firſt he ſaith: <hi>that the kingdome of heauen,</hi> that is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, <hi>is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man, which ſowed good ſeede in his feeld, but while men ſlept, there came his enemie &amp; ſowed tares amongest the wheate, and went his way. And when the blade was ſprong vp, and had brought foorth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo. Then came the ſeruauntes of the houſholde, and ſaide vnto him, Maſter ſowedst thou not &amp;c.</hi> and woulde preſently haue gone and gathered them vp, but the Lorde woulde not ſuffer them, leaſt while they went about to gather the tares, they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:25134:113"/>
plucked vp alſo with them the wheate. Therefore he willed that they might both growe together, vntill the harueſt, and in the time of harueſt, the reapers ſhall gather the tares, and binde them in ſheaues to burne them, but they, ſhal gather the good corne into the Lords barne. Afterwards, he expoundeth the ſaide ſimilitude, ſaying: <hi>He that ſoweth the good ſeede is the ſonne of man, and the fielde is the world,</hi>

                  <hi>the good ſeede are the children of the kingdome, the tares are the children of the wicked, and the enimie that ſoweth them is the diuell, the haruest is the end of the world, and the reapers be the angels. As then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of the world. The ſonne of man ſhall ſend foorth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome all things that offend, and them which do iniquitie, and ſhall cast them into a fornace of fire, there ſhall be wayling &amp; gnaſhing of teeth. Then ſhall the iust men ſhine as the ſunne in the kingdome of their father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſimilitude he ſaith,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.47.48.</note> 
                  <hi>That the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a drawe net cast into the ſea, that gathereth of all kinde of things: which when it is full the fiſhers draw to land on the ſhoare, and put the good by them

ſelues into their veſſels, and caſt the bad away.</hi> And afterwardes he giueth the expoſition thereof: <hi>So ſhall it be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at the end of the world:</hi>

                  <hi>The Angels ſhall goe foorth, and ſeuer the wicked from amongest the iust, and ſhall cast them into a fornace of fire, where ſhall be wayling and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe two ſimilitudes Ieſus Chriſte verie plainely expreſſeth, what ſhall be the viſible ſtate and condition of the Church, ſo long as it ſhal be on earth: that is to ſay, that the wicked ſhal continually be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein with the good, and that in ſuch ſorte, as the tares are amongeſt the good wheate in the fieldes, and as euill fiſhes are mingled with the good in the ſea. whereof followeth that which we haue ſaide before in the third Chapter, to wit, that all they which are in the Church, are not for al that of the Church.</p>
               <p>And indeede, experience hath in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhewed the ſame vnto vs, and maketh vs to behold the ſame as yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery day.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:25134:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Church, of whome GOD (who beholdeth all mens heartes) doth in the meane ſeaſon iudge otherwiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church euen in this reſpect, is not at any time in the world without wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle.</p>
               <p>The fourth point, which we muſt note here, is, that our ſanctification, is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or wrought all at one time, but there are three degrees or ſteppes thereof, to the end that it may be perfect.</p>
               <p>The firſt degree is during this life, when that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt giueth vs his holy ſpirite, thereby to reſiſt and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, the world, the diuell, ſinne, and our owne fleſh, to the end that we may loue good thinges, and hate euill. Herevnto may be applyed that which Saint Paule ſpeaketh of him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22.23. &amp;c.</note> writing vnto the Romanes, in the ſeuenth Chapter, verſe 22.23.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is after this life, when the ſoule enioieth the preſence of Ieſus Chriſt, giuing it ſelfe vnto all holineſſe, but our other part (that is the bodie) reſting it ſelfe in the duſt, without being able to applie it ſelfe, vnto any thing, to ſanctifie the name of God by.</p>

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:25134:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>The thirde ſhall be after the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when being perfectly ioyned with Ieſus Chriſte our head, we ſhall beholde God, euen as he is, who ſhall all in all, and that after ſuch manner and ſorte as Saint Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">1.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His queſtion, to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church can erre, hath bene diuers times toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and handled, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening &amp; vnfolding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we muſt firſt ſtriue to knowe, after what maner, or in what ſenſe, the word Church is here to be taken: I meane, whether we
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:25134:116"/>
muſt vnderſtand this of the Catholike and vniuerſall Church, or elſe of the particular Churches. But the controuerſie is not in my iudgement, of the Catholike Church: for we all agree herein, that ſhe can not erre as touching faith. And indeede howe ſhould ſhe erre, ſeeing that following Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt her head and her husband, ſhe walketh not in darkeneſſe, but in the light of life? On the other ſide, it is impoſſible, that all faithfull people vniuerſally, euen from the firſt vnto the laſt, ſhould fall into errour, for there haue bene alwayes ſome preſerued, through the goodneſſe and grace of GOD, by whome trueth it ſelfe, through other mens naughtineſſe, brought as it were to nothing, or at the leaſt deſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and forſaken, hath yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bene reſtored to her former force, and is yet ſtill maintained and preſerued. Wherefore this queſtion is touching a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. Touching which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good vnto vs, in the firſt place to heare the iudgement and reaſons, of the Romiſh Catholikes, vpon this that they affirme, that the Church ſo taken can not erre, following herein the Nouatians, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſtes, and other heretikes. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:25134:116"/>
we will ſhewe foorth, and put downe, our aduiſe and reaſons, to proue the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The Romiſh Catholikes thinke, that the Church can not erre, although ſhe doe and appoint any thing without the worde of GOD, for being guided by the holie Ghoſt, ſhe may goe and walke without the order and direction of the word, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe goe and walke, yet ſhe can not erre, or goe aſtray. But they ſeparate that which ought alwayes to remaine and a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bide ioyned together, for if the Churche followe not the word of God, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keepe her from error, as on the other ſide, if ſhe followe it, therein ſhe doth well, and can not erre. The reaſons wherby they would perſuade men, that the Church can not erre, are theſe following.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: Ieſus Chriſt doeth not at any time forſake his Church, which is his ſpouſe or wife. Wherefore it followeth, that it can not erre.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere by a diſtinction: So farre forth, as the Church foloweth Ieſus Chriſt, it can not be forſaken of him, and can not erre: but in as much, as it liuing in the world, doth ſtray from Chriſt, and goeth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:25134:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſide from Gods commaundements, it is forſaken of him and doth erre.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: The Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The piller and ground of truth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15.</note> Wherfore it can not erre.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that there is in this argument a double error, the one touching the word Church. For Saint Paule meaneth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, &amp; not any particular one. The other is concerning the meaning of the Apoſtle. For he calleth the Church, the piller and ground of truth, not that it is ſo ſimplie and indeede of it ſelfe, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of vs, bicauſe that the trueth of God, hath not place in the world, ſaue onely in the Church. For as much therfore as God maintaineth his trueth amongſt men, and maketh it alwayes to goe it right courſe,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 3. cap. 1. ad Timothae.</note> by the miniſterie of the Church, therefore is the Church called the piller and ground of the truth. To be ſhort, bicauſe that God him ſelfe commeth not downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and doth not euerie day ſend his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to maintaine his trueth among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to publiſh it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, but vſeth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Church, for this effect, that is to ſay, the preaching of the word, for this cauſe it is called the columne or pillar of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:25134:117"/>
trueth, becauſe that by the preachinge of the worde, it is reteined amongeſt men, &amp; countergarded, to the ende that it decaie not or periſh from the memory or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of men.</p>
               <p>The thirde reaſon: The Church is gouerned and guided by the holy ghoſte: how then can it erre?</p>
               <p>I aunſwere: that ſo farre foorth, as the Church is gouerned by the holy ghoſt, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it ſelfe to bee guided by him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth him, ſhee can not erre, but if ſhee doe the contrarie, ſhe may erre and doeth erre.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon. In the kingdome of heauen no error can haue any place.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.24.16.19.</note> For trueth reigneth therein, but the Church is the kingdome of heauen: it followeth then, that in the Church no error can haue place.</p>
               <p>All this is true of the Catholike Church, yea and of particular Churches alſo, ſo far foorth as they ſhew themſelues to be the kingdome of heauen, and not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this worlde, and of the fleſhe: that is to ſay, ſo farre foorth as they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies ſubiect in al things to Ieſus Chriſt the king of heauen, But were is that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:25134:118"/>
Church ſo obedient to Ieſus Chriſt the king of heauen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it erreth not, &amp; fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, in any points &amp; particular duties.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon: Councelles cannot erre, but the Church conſiſteth of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, therefore the Church cannot erre.</p>
               <p>This Syllogiſme pretendeth and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to proue an vncertayne thing, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, yet more vncertayne. For many examples doe plainely teſtifie, that the Councelles may erre, as indeede they haue oftentimes erred. And touching the firſt: the Councell that Ahab aſſembled, of foure hundred prophets, did not it erre? It is written that they being come to this wicked king to flatter him,<note place="margin">1. kings. 22.6. &amp;c.</note> Sathan was ſent out, by and from God, to be a lying ſpirite in their mouths: ſo al of them, with one conſent, condemned the trueth: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiah alone withſtanding them, who was reproued as an heretike, beaten &amp; put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 11.47.</note>The Councell which the high prieſtes and Phariſees aſſembled in Ieruſalem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ieſus Chriſt, did not it erre? wee ſee how they condemned Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; litle regarded: yea much diſpiſed his doctrine.</p>
               <p>And what ſhall wee ſay of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles

out, or to receiue that, which ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by councells and Synods. For it is altogether manifeſte and plaine, that Councels and Synodes may be deceiued. And therefore as touching their decrees and determinations, this is that wee haue to ſay, that we muſt bring the weight of them, and make it ſubiecte to the balance, that is to ſay, we muſt try and examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the worde of GOD, which is indeede the balance,<note place="margin">Gala. 1.8.</note> whervnto not onely men are ſubiect, but <hi>alſo the Angels,</hi> as Saint Paul teacheth in his Epiſtle to the Galathians.</p>
               <p>Wherefore whatſoeuer wee ſhall finde in them, conformable, and agreeable, to the proportion of faithe, and agreeing with the authoritie of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wee ought to receiue the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple or doubte. But if they propound vnto vs, and ſet out, things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that, we ought, and we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficultie or daunger, reiecte and refuſe them, as ſuſpected and daungerous doctrines. For as Saint Ierome hath ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaide,<note place="margin">Hierom. in 9 cap. Ierem.</note> 
                  <hi>we ought not to followe the errors of our fathers and predeceſſors, but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ſcriptures, and the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God:</hi> who teacheth vs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. de electi one &amp; elect. poteſt. cap. 5</note> and Panormitan haue concluded, that in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne faith, the Pope and his Biſhoppes, may not determine and decree any thing, againſt the worde of God: and that if a generall Councell ſhould come ſo farre, as to decline, and goe aſide, either through malice, or through ignoraunce of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, a ſimple man alleadging in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the worde of GOD, ought rather to bee hearde and yealded vnto then all they.</p>
               <p>Let vs enter or come nowe to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and let vs bring forth and alledge our reaſons to prooue that the Church may erre.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is this: That great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the people of Iſrael, which was in the wilderneſſe, with whome GOD had made a couenant, and had made them bounde vnto him, by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of benefites and good turnes, and had giuen vnto them ſacramentes, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which were, as it were viſible ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his grace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great company I ſay, was a verie goodly &amp; a verie excellent Church. But they were vilely deceaued and erred fowly, when forſaking the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:25134:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they made vnto themſelues a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calfe offering and giuing vnto it, that honour which was due to God alone, yea and Aaron himſelfe the high prieſt, did not ſo conſtantly and boldly withſtande them as he ought, but rather conſented thereto indeede, wherefore it followeth, that the Church may erre and be deceiued.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon: The Church in old time did offer and giue the holy ſupper, to litle infants, ſtaying and grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vpon the place of Saint Iohn, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 9.53.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> And this cuſtome was in vſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Pope Innocent, Saint Cyprian and Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, as it appeareth by their writinges.</p>
               <p>But nowe this is not any more vſed, for children which can not prooue and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues, are not at this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to the partaking of the ſacrament. Wherefore the Church in olde time hath erred, or elſe it erreth now. But if we wold anſwere, that the Church hath power and authoritie to chaunge ſuch cuſtomes and manners: I replie to the contrarie: for now the queſtion is not here, of a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the vſe, but of the word of God,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:25134:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is alwayes conſtant, and not ſubiect to any change, as to ſay, that to day it hath one ſenſe and vnderſtanding, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe an other, wherefore if the place of S. Iohn, commaund to giue the ſupper to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle infantes of neceſſitie, as the forenamed auncient fathers, haue vnderſtood and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the ſame, the Church hath done well in time heretofore, to followe that commaundement, and at this time it er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in not folowing it any longer. Or elſe if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid place, be not to be referred proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnto the holy ſupper, neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to diſtribute and giue the ſacrament to infants: but it is of neceſſitie required, that he to whome we muſt adminiſter the ſaide ſacrament,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2.</note> haue knowledge to <hi>trie &amp; examine him ſelfe,</hi> according to S. Pauls do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as in deede this is the pure and only trueth: it followeth then, that the Church hath in former time erred, to admit little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to the holie ſupper, and that at this day it doth well to practiſe the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: If the Church could not erre, Saint Paul had without cauſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.28</note> 
                  <hi>least the Corinthians</hi> (whome he calleth a Church) <hi>ſhould through the ſubtiltie of the ſerpent be corrupted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and turned away from
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:25134:122"/>
the ſimplicitie that is in Christ.</hi> And indeede, in vaine ſhould he haue called the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Corinthians and Galathians,<note place="margin">Gala. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Churches,</hi> which yet notwithſtanding er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in doctrine, in faith, in manners, and in life. But Saint Paule did nothing of al this, without cauſe, or in vaine, otherwiſe Saint Paule himſelfe ſhould haue bene deceiued. wherefore it followeth, that the Church may erre.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: Thoſe that can not erre, haue no neede of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: but the Church hath neede of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, for Ieſus Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it a forme of praier, hath commanded it, to demaund &amp; aske of GOD, <hi>forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſinnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 6.12.</note> Wherefore it foloweth, that the Church may erre,</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon. The Church which was in olde time in Ieruſalem, was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reproued of error, by the Prophetes, which thing declareth, that the Church is not in this world, without will and deede to erre. But to the end I may not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, in recyting by peecemeale, and as it were one by one, all the ſentences, which make mention of the falles of the Church, let men reade that, which is written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Church indeede hath a very great authoritie among men, in ſo much as, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to heare the ſame, if we will not be accounted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt God. Yet notwithſtanding, ſeeing ſhe is the wife and ſcholler of Ieſus Chriſte, ſhee ought alwayes to bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto him, as vnto her husband head and teacher. And therfore this is an article, which we muſt hold inuiolable and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach, to wit, that the Church ought to depend and hang on Chriſt, and his word, and to haue her authoritie, from the ſame word, and not on the other ſide, that the worde of Chriſt, ſhould depend and hang vpon the credite and authoritie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:25134:124"/>
from the Church. Notwithſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are found which holde altogether the contrarie, ſetting (as we ſay) the cart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the horſes, and plowe or waine before the oxen, and vtterly ouerthrowing all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For they ſuppoſe, that the holie ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath no more certaintie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, than it pleaſeth the Church, that by her allowance and conſent, it ſhall haue. And theſe be the Romiſh Catholikes, who ſpeake of the Church after this manner, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it authoritie ouer &amp; aboue the word of God, to make men to beleeue, that what ſo euer it decreeth, determineth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, we muſt hold her iudgement, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and reſolution, as a certaine oracle, comming from heauen, and to be ſhort, as an article of our beliefe. And beholde their reaſons for this.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon: The Church by her iudgement hath brought to paſſe, that the holie ſcripture hath bene acknowledged for the true word of God, and hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, ſeparated and ſundered it, from al all other writings what ſo euer, which men haue publiſhed and brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. For who is it that in the beginning hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured vs, that the holie ſcripture is the word
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:25134:124"/>
of God, but the Church alone? And who is it, that euen to this day, can certifie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame word of God, is come ſafe, ſound, and whole, euen vnto our age, but onely the ſame Church? Wherefore it followeth, that the authoritie and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the holie ſcripture, dependeth vpon the authoritie and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere two things, or two manner of wayes. Firſt, that this is a moſt wicked opinion to ſay, that without the Church, the word of God could not haue, a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witneſſe, to commend and ſet forth the authoritie and credite thereof vnto vs? Let vs heare what Saint Auguſtine ſaith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note place="margin">Aug. de aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpt. virg. Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. cap. 1.</note> The authoritie of the trueth (ſaith he) is fruitfull and plentifull: and if ſhe be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examined, men ſhall finde, that of her ſelfe, ſhe maketh her ſelfe to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne.<note place="margin">Alfonſus de Caſt. li. 1. ca. 8. cont. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſes.</note> Wherefore Alfonſus de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro, hath ſometimes ſaide: ſeeing that the holie ſcripture is come foorth from GOD, it hath of it ſelfe alreadie deſerued, that we ſhould giue truſt vnto it, and beleeue it. And when the Church publiſheth this, that it is giuen by God, ſhe doth wholie, euen as a witneſſe, which beareth witneſſe to ſome thing. So that the trueth of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:25134:125"/>
is certain, not bicauſe of the witneſſe, but by reaſon of it ſelfe, and the credite it hath, and not bicauſe the church receiueth it, and publiſheth it, but bicauſe that GOD hath giuen it, and made the ſame manifeſt vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, is this a ſmall matter, that we haue the teſtimonie of the holie ſpirite dwelling in our hearts?<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.13. 1. Ioh. 2, 27.</note> It is ſaide that it is his peculiar office, <hi>to guide and leade vs into all trueth, and to teach vs all things.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it followeth, that he teacheth vs this trueth: that the holie ſcripture is of God, and from him.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.12.</note> It is ſaide moreouer, <hi>that we haue receiued the ſpirite of God, that we might knowe the thinges that are giuen to vs of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.14.</note> Alſo, <hi>that the things of the ſpirite of God, are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> that is to ſay, by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, mouing, and working of the holie ſpirite. Wherefore it followeth, that the holie ſpirite teacheth vs, and maketh vs to diſcerne, betwene theſe bookes which we ought to receiue without gaineſaying, and the other, which we ought to reiect and refuſe.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will ſay, that this article or point is daungerous, bicauſe that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes oftentimes bragge, that they haue the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:25134:125"/>
ſpirit of God, which they haue not indeed: and we knowe howe they haue alwayes indeuoured, to make their doctrines of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and credite, through their inward reuelations, which they haue imagined to proceed, from the holie Ghoſt. But we can eaſily aunſwere this: to wit, that in this matter, we can eaſily auoyde al daunger, if we vſe and followe the remedies which S. Iohn doth furniſh vs withal, when he ſaith: that <hi>we ought not to beleeue euery ſpirite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>but to trie and proue the ſpirites, whether they are of God or no.</hi> And what ſhall be the meane and way of this triall and examination? euen the word of God, as we ſee, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the men of Berea,<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> did proue S. Paule his ſpirit and doctrine. And to this meane doth Chryſoſtome ſend vs, when he ſaith thus: <hi>Many boaſt of the ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. de ſanct. &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. ſpiritu</note> 
                  <hi>but they which bring any thing of their owne, doe falſly pretend the ſame.</hi> As Chriſt witneſſed, that he ſpake not of him ſelfe, bicauſe that his doctrine was taken out of the lawe and Prophets: in like manner, if any vnder the title and name of the ſpirite, ſhall bring vnto vs any thing, which is not contained in the Goſpell, let vs not beleue it. For as Chriſt is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, and fulfilling of the lawe and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:25134:126"/>
Prophetes: ſo is the holie Ghoſt of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>But how can we by this way or meane, diſcerne and knowe the ſpirites, that is to ſay, whether the doctrine which they ſhall propound and ſet foorth vnto vs, be from the holie Ghoſt or no? After two ſortes or by two meanes, you ſhall knowe this. Firſt, if it tend to this end, to exalt, eſtabliſh and ſet vp the glorie of God.<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.18.</note> For as Ieſus Chriſte ſaith: <hi>He that ſeeketh the glorie of God is true, and no vnrighteouſneſſe is in him.</hi> Secondly, if it be conformable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>to the proportion of faith,</hi> that is to ſay, if it agree and accord well, with the heads &amp; foundations of Chriſtian religion, whereof we haue ſpoken more largely heretofore, in the fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, that I aunſwere, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the foreſaide reaſon of the Romiſh Catholikes, is, that the conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is not neceſſarie, neither well grounded, when they ſay, that the Church yeldeth teſtimonie to the word of God, and doth commend the ſame vnto vs, that therefore the certaintie and authoritie of the worde of God, dependeth vpon the authoritie &amp; iudgement of the Church. For as we haue
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:25134:126"/>
but a little while agoe alledged out of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſus de Caſtro: The word of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, not by reaſon of the Church, which beareth witneſſe thereof, but bicauſe of it ſelfe, and his owne credite. The Apoſtles yelded teſtimonie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.17. Act. 1.8.</note> and bare witneſſe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, And who is he that will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, that Ieſus Chriſte his authoritie doth depend of the authoritie and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtles? The Goldſmith tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the golde, and putteth a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that which is good and pure, and that which is naughtie mettall. But doth he therefore by his triall and proofe make that the golde is either good or euill? A parliament receiueth ſome edict or lawe which commeth from the King, that it may be publiſhed and proclamed. Inquirie is diligently made, whether it come from the King or no: Afterwardes all knowe that it commeth from the King: what doth the parliament then? It is true, that it alloweth the edict, that it acknowledgeth the ſame, that it beareth witneſſe to it, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ſetteth out the ſame, yea, and if neede be, interpreteth it, according to the Kings intent and meaning: But doth the parliament for al this, cauſe it or make it to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:25134:127"/>
be the Kings lawe? Doth it giue authoritie to it? Hath it any authoritie, to chaunge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in it, or to add any thing to it, or to clippe, or take any thing what ſo euer away from it? It is certaine, no. Euen ſo ſtandeth the caſe with the Church. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be an excellent teſtimonie to the word of God, yet it can not at any hande giue it authoritie, as to ſay, that the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the word of God, hangeth vpon the authoritie and iudgement of the Church. For when the Church acknowledgeth and alloweth the word of God, and doth put a difference betweene it, &amp; the doctrines and inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions of men, ſhe doth no other thing, but heare the voice of her paſtor,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.5.</note> &amp; diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth &amp; knoweth it <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voice of a ſtranger.</hi> Nowe there is great difference betweene diſcerning the Paſtors voice, from aſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and adding authoritie &amp; credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, bringing to paſſe, and that according to trueth, that it ſhould be ſuch or ſuch, that is either true or falſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is: The Church is more auncient, than the ſcriptures. For in the time of Adam, Abell, Seth, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Iaacob, there was no ſcripture: For Moſes was the firſt penman or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:25134:127"/>
of matters concerning religion, and yet notwithſtanding there was a Church. Wherfore it followeth, that the authoritie of the church, is aboue the authoritie of the holie ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt and formoſt I aunſwere, that the conſequence of this argument is none at all. For graunt it, that one thing be more auncient and olde than an other, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not for all that, that it ſhould be of greater authoritie and credite: otherwiſe we muſt inferre, that Moſes hath more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, than Ieſus Chriſte, and the lawe more than the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching the antecedent or former propoſition, I ſay that it is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall, captious, and full of deceit. For albeit, that in theſe firſt times of the world, there was no ſcripture, which the fathers vſed, yet for all that, the word of God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to be, bicauſe it was written and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in the fathers hearts, and moreouer ſounded verie clearely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, which word, was in good time brought and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, firſt by Moſes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by others, and therevpon called, the holie ſcripture: wherefore ſeeing that the holie ſcripture and Gods word, is nothing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:25134:128"/>
but one and the ſelfe ſame thing, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verie well, that if our firſt fathers haue had the word of God, they haue had alſo in ſubſtance, the holie ſcriptures.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. cap. 5.</note>The third reaſon: S. Auguſtine hath ſaide: <hi>I would not beleeue the Gospell, if the authoritie of the Catholike Church, did not moue me thereto.</hi> Wherefore it is certaine, that the Goſpel taketh his authoritie from the Church,</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that the conſequence is ſtarke naught, for that which S. Auguſtine ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to one purpoſe, or in one reſpect, is applied to another end. This holie Doctor ſpeaketh ſo, as hauing regard to that, he was then, when he tooke the part of the Manichees, &amp; as it were diſputing againſt them. Now the Manichees would, that the Epiſtles of Manicheus their author, which they called Fundamentall, containing in it all their falſe opinions, ſhould be of like &amp; equall authoritie, which the Apoſtles Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Beſide, they allowed one part of the Goſpell, and diſallowed an other, and that not by the aduiſe and iudgement of the Church, but of their own proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular authoritie. Saint Auguſtine hauing taken in hand, to confute the ſaide Epiſtle
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:25134:128"/>
in the beginning ſpeaketh thus: The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle beginneth after this manner: <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and appointment of God the Father: I aske, who is this Manicheus? you will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſte: I beleeue it not. What wilt thou ſay thereto? Perhappes thou wilt bring foorth the Gospell, and thereby thou wilt lift vppe and establiſh the perſon of Manicheus. But what if thou haddest to doe and deale with a man, who doth not yet beleeue the Gospell? what wouldeſt thou doe, when he ſhould ſay vnto thee, I beleeue not the Gospell? For as touching my ſelfe, I would not beleeue the Gospell, if the authoritie of Catholike Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che did not moue me thereto.</hi> Beholde Saint Auguſtines wordes, by which it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt, that he mindeth not to infer, that the Goſpell hangeth vpon the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and authoritie of the Church, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Church hath great weight, to induce and moue the miſcreants and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, to beleeue the Goſpell. This holie Doctor then ſpeaketh not, of the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his faith, but of the beginning thereof, that is to ſay, of the occaſion and outward means, by which he was prouoked &amp; ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vppe, to beleeue the Goſpell, when he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:25134:129"/>
was a Manichean heretike, and not as yet a Chriſtian, to wit, bicauſe he ſawe the good accord, conſent, and agreement of the Church in receiuing the Goſpell. In the fourth Chapter he confeſſed, that in former time he maintained the Manichees part, &amp; that he was verie eger and ſharpe therein, and blinded in the doctrine of their ſect. Nowe he ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Howe wilt thou proue, that Manicheus is an Apoſtle of Chriſt? ſhall this be by the Gospell? But if ſome one that beleeueth not the Gospell, would ſay vnto thee, I beleeue not the Gospell, what hast thou to replie?</hi> As <hi>if he ſhould ſay,</hi> wouldeſt thou not purpoſe, put downe, and ſhewe vnto him the authoritie and teſtimonie of the Church? For as touching my ſelfe, in the time that I was a Manichean, I had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the Goſpel, if the authoritie and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the Catholike church, had not driuen me thereto. As if againe he ſhould ſay: For as concerning my ſelf, when I was of your faction and ſect, I was ſo ſettled and ſtaied in your opinions, and had heard them ſo attentiuely and diligently, yea I beleeued them ſo ſtedfaſtly, and did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them with ſuch courage &amp; ſtomake, (this is that which he ſpeaketh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:25134:129"/>
Chapter) that verie hardly I had euer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and renounced them, to beleeue the Goſpell, if the authoritie and teſtimonie of the Church, had not induced, moued and prouoked me thereto.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: He that hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power, to take away, or to change ſome thing in the word of God, hath alſo authoritie ouer it. But ſo it is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church hath authoritie and power, to take away, or to change ſomething in the word of God: It followeth therefore, that the Churche hath authoritie ouer and aboue it.</p>
               <p>They thus proue the aſſumption, which is the ſecond propoſition or ſentence of of the reaſon. Saint Peter had authoritie and power, to take away and to chaunge ſome thing, in the word of GOD, for he changed the forme of baptiſme preſcribed by Ieſus Chriſt, as it appeareth by this, that Ieſus Chriſt hauing commaunded to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <hi>in the name of the Father, &amp; of the Sonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 28.19</note> 
                  <hi>and of the holie Ghost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> Saint Peter changing this forme, hath enioyned and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men to be baptiſed in the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt onely. As it is written in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Actes verſe 38. Nowe if Saint Peter haue had this authoritie and this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:25134:130"/>
why alſo ſhould not the whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che haue it, as wel as he?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, firſt for the conſequence, that it is not neceſſarie and good. For who is he that will yelde to this, that all that, which was in former time permitted to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſhould nowe be permitted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and miniſters of the Church, who are their ſucceſſors?</p>
               <p>Secondly I ſay, that that which is taken from Saint Peter as true and right, is falſe. For Saint Peter did in no caſe chaunge the forme of baptiſme: and in the place of the Actes before alledged, it is not ſaide, that they muſt be baptiſed in the name of Ieſus Chriſt onely,<note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> but ſimplie ſaide thus, <hi>and be baptiſed euerie one of you, in the name of Ieſus Christ.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Act. 8.12.</note>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:25134:130"/>
to wit, the father, of whom the ſonne was annoynted, and the ſonne, which was annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; the holie Ghoſt, by whom or with whom he was annoynted.</hi> Beholde the aduiſe and iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſentences, who doth not altogether ſatisfie vs, though he ſpeak much for vs. For whether we regard the ſubſtance of the ſacraments, or elſe the forme thereof, we holde that the Lords or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ought to be retained and folowed in the whole, and through the whole, and that it doth not belong to any particular perſon, no not to the Church it ſelfe, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or chaunge any thing therein. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, as I haue alreadie ſaide, Saint Peter did not chaunge the forme of baptiſme: But marke this: His intent &amp; purpoſe was to teach, that the foundation, accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fulfilling of baptiſme, is in Ieſus Chriſte alone. For to be baptiſed in the name of Chriſt, is taken and vſed by S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for to be receiued to grace and fauour in baptiſme, by the name of Ieſus Chriſte. So that this manner of ſpeach which Saint Peter vſeth, is not in any ſort to be referred to the forme of baptiſme, but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that all the vertue, power, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of baptiſme conſiſteth onely in Ieſus
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:25134:131"/>
Chriſt alone, bicauſe that all that, which baptiſme doth repreſent and figure vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.7. Rom. 6.4.</note> is comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in him alone. <hi>For by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, we are waſhed &amp; purged from all our ſinnes, and by baptiſme buried with him, to the end that as he is raiſed vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead by the glorie of the father, ſo we alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift reaſon: The Church hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Sabaoth to the Lordes day, or that which we call Sunday, although that God by expreſſe writing, commaunded the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and keeping of the ſaid Sabaoth. Wherefore it followeth, that the Church hath power and authoritie ouer the holie ſcripture.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere in the firſt place, That the Church hath changed nothing at all, of the commaundement, touching the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sabaoth, in or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, but onely in or concerning the circumſtance. For the thing or matter abideth always, that is to ſay, the ſubſtance of the commaundement, ſeeing that one day of the weeke is reſerued, to be imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; beſtowed vpon the holie reſt, which thing is enioyned by the commandement, as being indeede the veritie and truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:25134:131"/>
So that the obſeruation and keeping thereof is only chaunged in reſpect of the time, which chaunge doth not derogate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing from the commaundement, and neither altereth nor chaungeth any thing therin, of that which God minded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and commaund to vs.</p>
               <p>Next: the commaundement of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, in reſpect of the figure was tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and indured but a ſeaſon, and therfore it ought to haue an end, as the other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the lawe had. Wherefore the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was taken away and changed, not by the authoritie of the Church properly, or as you would ſay, of it owne authoritie, but by the trueth it ſelfe, which declared and ſhewed it ſelfe in Ieſus Chriſt: wherevpon alſo the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Col. 2.16.17</note> 
                  <hi>Let no man therefore condemne you in meat and drinke, or in reſpect of an holie day, or of the newe moone, or of the Sabaoth day, which are but a ſhadowe of things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixt reaſon: The Apoſtles decreed in the firſt Councel which they held in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,<note place="margin">Act. 15.29.</note> that the Chriſtians <hi>ſhould abstaine from a bloud, and from that that is ſtrangled:</hi> which decree, yea brought and put into writing, the Church hath taken away and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:25134:132"/>
chaunged, after the time of the Apoſtles, giuing leaue to chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to vſe both bloud, and that that is ſtrangled. It foloweth then, that it is lawfull for the Church, to change ſome thing in the word of God, and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent that the Church is aboue the ſame word.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere that the place of the Actes, touching that which the Apoſtles deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Councel, which they held in Ieruſalem is ill vnderſtood, and yet more ill applied, to fetch and drawe from it ſuch a conſequence. For the Church after the Apoſtles, hath not eſtabliſhed any thing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the decree of the Apoſtles, in that they haue ſuffered Chriſtians, to vſe and eate bloud, and that that is ſtrangled. For the decree of the Apoſtles was made, ſet vp and publiſhed, for a time onely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to end. The Church in the time of the Apoſtles, was builded as well of the Gentiles as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes. Some weake ones amongeſt the Iewes, thought, that they were yet bound in their conſciences, to the obſeruation of the lawe of Moſes, that is to ſay, to the ceremonies thereof: The Gentiles on the other ſide, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues with that Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:25134:132"/>
which Ieſus Chriſt hath brought vnto vs, would without any difference vſe, all manner of meates, and ſo amongſt the reſt, bloud, and that that was ſtrangled. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Apoſtles, leaſt that ſo free a vſe of bloud, and of that that was ſtrangled, might breede and bring ſome offence to the weake Iewes, determined and decreed in their Councel, that euerie one ſhould abſtaine from ſuch meate for a time, til that they might ſee a good agreement &amp; peace, betweene theſe two peoples. Nowe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, the feare of ſuch an offence being taken away, the Church iudged, that the obſeruation and keping of the ſaid decree, was not any more neceſſarie, or any longer needfull, and therefore reſpecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpoſe of the Apoſtles, gaue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the faithfull to vſe all kinde of meates, or elſe (to ſpeake better) did by the word of God declare vnto them the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that they had to vſe all maner of meats without, in any thing altering or chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the intent and purpoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they made and eſtabliſhed the foreſaide decree, not being appointed and ſet vp by them, but for a time onely.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the reaſons
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:25134:133"/>
of the Romiſh Catholikes, who affirme that the certaintie, and trueth of the worde of God, doth depend of the iudgement &amp; authoritie of the Church. Beholde nowe our reaſons to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: The certaintie of the Churche dependeth vpon the authoritie of Gods word. It followeth then that the contrarie can not be true, to wit, that the certaintie of the word of God ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the authoritie of the Church. Nowe we proue the antecedent or former propoſition, by that which the holie Ghoſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Church is builded vpon the foundation and doctrine of the Ppophetes and Apostles.</hi> Wherevpon it followeth, that the Church dependeth vpon the authoritie of the ſame doctrine: And herevnto belong, the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the ancient Doctors, which we haue cited and quoted before in the third Chapter, by which this is ſhewed &amp; proued, that the Church is marked, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and knowne, by the holie ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note>The ſecond reaſon: <hi>The holie ſcripture being giuen by inspiration of God,</hi> as S. Paule ſaith, hath the authoritie from it ſelfe, as we haue declared in the beginning of this Chapter, in aunſwering the firſt reaſon of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:25134:133"/>
Catholikes: wherein we haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the iudgement of Alfonſus de Caſtro. It followeth then, that it taketh not credit or authoritie from the Churche, neither more nor leſſe, than the edict and lawe of the King, which hath the authoritie it hath, from it ſelfe, that is to ſay, from the King, from whome it proceedeth and commeth, and not from the parliament, to which it is ſent, although that the ſame be allowed, praiſed, yea and expounded ſometimes by the ſaide parliament.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: If the word of God ought to be heard aboue the Church, then certainly it doth not hang of the authoritie of the Church, but that the word of GOD ought to be heard aboue the Church, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this which S. Paule ſaith, that it ought to be heard aboue the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>yea the Angels them ſelues.</hi> Wherefore it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the word of God doth not hang of the authoritie of the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon:<note place="margin">Aug. cont. Max. lib. 3. cap. 14.</note> S. Saint Auguſtine openly declareth, that the holie ſcripture is aboue the Councels, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent aboue the Church repreſented by Councels. For writing to Maximinus the Arrian, touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word Homouſios, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:25134:134"/>
is to ſay, conſubſtantiall, or of the ſelfe ſame ſubſtance together with the father, which word was confirmed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Nice, and on the other ſide, diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Councel of Ariminum, in the time of the Emperor Conſtantine, he ſaith thus: <hi>Nowe I haue not to vſe or alledge, the Councel of Nice, neither thou the Councel of Ariminum, to preuaile thereby one of vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an other. For as I am not bound to the Councel of Ariminum, ſo art not thou bound to the Councel of Nice.

And therefore Saint Cyprian hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the diſcipline of the Church,<note place="margin">Cyprian de tract. virgin.</note> 
                  <hi>The keeper of faith, and the mistreſſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> For if it ſhall be lawfull for euerie one, to doe what they will, without
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:25134:135"/>
being helde backe by ſome bridle, what confuſion and diſorder, ſhall we ſee in the Church? The ſame Doctor compareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the diſcipline <hi>to the rudder or helme of a ſhip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. lib. 2. epiſt. 7.</note> thereby to declare, not onely how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable the ſame is for vs, but alſo howe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and needfull. For ſeeing that the Church is in this world, as a ſhip vpon the ſea, that is to ſay, ſubiect to the billowes, waues, and tempeſtes of tyrants and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, yea to windes and whirlewinds of falſe doctrine, how could it be able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſtand, if together with the word of God, it had not for the ordering and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therof, her diſcipline, to be as it were a rampart, ground worke, foundation and ſtay? Wherefore thoſe, which either diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe or deſpiſe this remedie (which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to preſerue the Church from diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſcattering abroad, to keepe men in the obedience of God, and to holde euerie one in his order and calling) labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour no other thing, what ſo euer they will pretend, than to ouerthrowe the ſtate of the Church, and to bring into the ſame all beaſtly exceſſe, and barbarous diſorder, and that they are to be eſteemed in the number of them, of whom is ſpoken in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:25134:135"/>
fiftieth Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.16.17.</note> who giuing them ſelues to all iniquitie, &amp; hating correction and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or to be reformed, are reproued for this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they tooke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake of &amp; rehearſe the ordinances of God, &amp; to take his couenant and word in their mouthes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond head or point is,<note place="margin">The diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline doth not ſo much as ſet a foot into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> that the Eccleſiaſticall or Church diſcipline, incro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not any thing at all vpon the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates charge and office. For firſt, the iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and gouernement of the Churche, and the ciuill iuriſdicton or gouernement differ greatly one of them from an other: bicauſe that the one is ſpirituall, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to the inward man, and the other is bodily and outwarde. Therefore Saint Paul ſaid:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mightie, through God, to caſt downe holdes.</hi> The Church then hath not priſons, or ſergeants, or ſwords, thereby bodily to puniſh euill doers, neither vſeth it force of handes, confiſcation or loſſe of goods, or amercements to puniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their goods and riches, but onely draweth out and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupieth,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.17.</note> the <hi>ſpirituall ſword of Gods word</hi> to correct men, and to bring them to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Magiſtrate draweth out, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his materiall ſword, to puniſh them
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:25134:136"/>
either in their goods, or in their bodyes. And ſo both of them doe their duetie, the one of them not bringing any preiudice or hurt to the other, but contrariwiſe, verie well ayding them ſelues betweene them ſelues, and helping one an other, and being moſt neceſſarie and needfull in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charges and offices, the one not being able, to do that which the other doth. One example to make the matter plaine. If ſome one haue committed whordome, and ſo by that meanes and fault, the ciuill lawes ſhall be tranſgreſſed &amp; broken, and the Church alſo offended: Nowe in reformed Courtes and places of lawe, ſuch a one ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed either by impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or by ſome other puniſhment: and ſo the offender, ſhall haue ſatisfied the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates lawes, but yet the offence ſhal not be repaired or reformed in the Church. For it may be, that ſuch an euill doer will in ſteede of giuing or ſhewing ſome ſigne of repentaunce, murmur, be angrie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully deale with the Church. In ſuch a caſe the Church, before that it receiueth him to the holie ſupper, ſhall require of him, a publike teſtimonie and open token of this repentance, and by conſequent, as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:25134:136"/>
the Magiſtrate ſhal haue his iuſtice ſatisfied and aunſwered, ſo ſhall the Church haue her diſcipline ſatisfied and aunſwered. In ſumme, the Magiſtrate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſing and executing of his office, reſpecteth mens goods and their bodyes, but the Church in the exerciſe &amp; execution of her diſcipline, regardeth ſimplie and onely, the ſoules &amp; conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſo farre off is it, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, derogateth or taketh any thing at all away from the Magiſtrate, that contrariwiſe ſhe maintaineth the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that is due vnto him. For if ſhe tend to no other end, or ſhoot at no other mark, but to cauſe vs to practiſe that, which is contained in the word of God, and ſo it is that Gods word teacheth vs to ſubmit our ſelues, &amp; to yeld our ſelues ſubiect, to our Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.5. Tit. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and that not for feare of wrath onely, but alſo for conſcience ſake,</hi> who ſeeth not this that ſhe is eſtabliſhed and ſet vp by God, to maintaine the Magiſtrate in his authoritie, and to cauſe that obedience to be rendred and yelded to him, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto him.</p>
               <p>And alſo this is to be noted, that the church hath not any particular member or
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:25134:137"/>
perſon in it, which ſhe doth not moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly make ſubiect to the Magiſtrate, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therin that which S. Paul ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let euerie ſoule</hi> (that is to ſay, euerie perſon or man) <hi>be ſubiect vnto the higher powers.</hi> Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which the Prieſts, Friers, &amp; Monkes of the Romiſh Church, and in ſumme, all thoſe of the Popes Cleargie, ſhould here verie well take them ſelues by the noſe, that if it may be, they may be aſhamed, and ſo come to repentance. For whereas they reproue and accuſe vs, to be rebels to our ſuperiors, I would wiſh them to looke to them ſelues, and to marke howe farre they ſhewe them ſelues obedient, and by what title and right they can boaſt them ſelues to be exempted from all ſuch ſubiection. It may be, that they will not beleeue Saint Pauls words, without the interpretation of ſome of the fathers, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then well looke to, &amp; marke, that which Chryſoſtome hath written vpon this place, whoſe wordes are verie cleare and plaine.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 13. cap. ad Roman.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Apostle ſpeaketh thus</hi> (ſaith Chryſoſtome) <hi>Let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that this commaundement is directed to all; yea to Prieſtes and Monkes, and not onely to them, which are buſied and occupied
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:25134:137"/>
about the affaires of this preſent life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be it, that thou art an Apostle, or an Euangeliſt, or a Prophete, or any other, thou oughteſt to be ſubiect to the Magiſtrate. For this ſubiection doth not hinder, diſanull, or take away godlineſſe.</hi> Theſe are this holy Doctors owne wordes, who if he liued at this day, I leaue it to your ſelues to thinke of, howe ſharply and earneſtly would he ſet vp him ſelfe, againſt the Romiſh Prieſtes,<note place="margin">Cauſa. 15. quaeſt. 6. cap. Alius Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus &amp;c.</note> and namely againſt him, who doth not onely not ſubiect or ſubmit him ſelfe to Kinges, but alſo maketh Kings ſubiect to him, and tranſlateth to his owne proper vſe, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Empires: and is not in the meane while aſhamed to ſay, that he is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſtes vicar, and the ſucceſſor of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Matt. 17.27</note> wheras indeede Ieſus Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected him ſelfe to Magiſtrates, <hi>yea euen to pay them tribute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 22.25.</note> and hath ſaide vnto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: <hi>that the Kings of the earth beare rule &amp;c. but it ſhall not be ſo amongest you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirde head or point is,<note place="margin">The diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ought to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by the Conſiſtorie.</note> that for the exerciſing and executing of the diſcipline, there muſt be in the Church a Conſiſtorie, that is to ſay, an aſſemblie, or a Councell, compacted &amp; made of the miniſters &amp; El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to watch ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſolencies,<note place="margin">Matt. 10.17. Act. 22.5.</note> breakings
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:25134:138"/>
out and offences, which may fall amongeſt the members of the Church. This conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was heretofore in vſe among the Iewes, and was called Synedrion and Presbyterie. Nowe if when corruption burſt into the Church, men abuſed both the title, and the right and lawfull vſe of the Conſiſtorie, it followeth not for al that, that Ieſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, would haue it aboliſhed, but rather haue brought it backe againe to his former ſafetie and ſoundneſſe, and vſed the ſame, when the time was for it. This is that which Saint Paul meaneth, when wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.8.</note> he ſaith: <hi>Let him that ruleth, doe it with diligence.</hi> For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that he ſpeaketh not to Magiſtrates, but he ſpeaketh to the Elders, Auncients, and ouerwatchers, who were ioyned to and with the Paſtours, for the ruling and guiding of the Church. Alſo, when he ſaith to Timothie:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Elders that rule well, are worthie double honour, ſpecially they which labour in the worde and doctrine.</hi> For he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there two ſortes of Auncients or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſome that trauell in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſuch are the Paſtours and Miniſters, and other ſome which exerciſe an other charge, as the Elders, or as we ſay, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchers,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:25134:138"/>
who are appointed to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to, and to watch ouer the manners of the people.</p>
               <p>But to make this point more plaine: we muſt ſpeake yet ſomewhat more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Saint Paule writing to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.7.8.</note> diuideth the functions or offices of the Church into two ſortes or kindes, into the office of Prophetes,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.18. Tit. 1.6. &amp;c. Philip. 1.1.</note> and into the office of Deacons, as in an other place, he maketh mention, but of Biſhops and Deacons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Act. 6.3.4.</note> Actes 6.2.3.4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Againe, he diuideth theſe two kindes or ſortes, into certaine other. Of Prophets he maketh two rankes or orders: ſome he calleth Paſtours, and the other Doctours, whoſe charge and office is, to labour in the word and doctrine, as we haue heretofore ſufficiently declared in the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Of Deacons, he maketh three kindes. Some giue themſelues wholy to the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and diſtributions of the almes, which properly indeede are called Deacons. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome are they to whome ſpecially and chiefly this charge belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, to watch ouer
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:25134:139"/>
the maners of the flocke, and ouer ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as may fall out amongeſt them, and theſe are properly called Ancients, Elders, and ouerwatchers. The third ſort, are they which haue a ſpeciall care of the ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to be diligent about them, to take care ouer them, and to vſe them courteouſly, gently, and well, and ſuch were heretofore the widdowes,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.9. &amp;c.</note> whereof mention is made in the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Touching which matter this is to be marked, that in ſucceſſion and proceſſe of time, certaine Councels and Synods ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that women ſhould be no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into ſuch offices and charges of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aconeſſes, and this was done to the end, they might meete withall and preuent all inconueniences and offences riſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in the place and ſteede of which wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Diaconeſſes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like adminiſtration &amp; office, was commended to and laide vpon men, lawfully choſen and called thereto.</p>
               <p>Nowe marke howe theſe offices and charges, be at this day exerciſed and vſed in the reformed Churches. As concerning the Paſtors and Doctors, they handle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate on, and expound the worde, as we haue ſaide, and ſhewed before in the ninth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:25134:139"/>
Chapter, the Elders and Deacons not any manner of way medling therewith.</p>
               <p>There are two other companies or ſorts. The one is called the aſſemblie or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which haue care of the poore: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Conſiſtorie: Both in the one and in the other the Paſtors are vſually to be found and had, as well to make publike praier, as to giue aduice and counſell, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that which ought to be done.</p>
               <p>In the aſſemblie or companie which haue care of the poore, they take aduiſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for collections and diſtributions, for aide &amp; aſſiſtance to be giuen to the poore, and that the ſick and diſeaſed may be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and ſuccoured. And then are preſent with the Deacons, ſo many of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Elders, yea and of other citizens and towne dwellers, or pariſhioners, as occaſion and neceſſitie requireth.</p>
               <p>The Conſiſtorie is compoſed, made, and conſiſteth, of the Paſtors and Elders, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto alſo are admitted and receiued the Doctors and Deacons, ſo farre foorth, and in as much as they ſhall iudge it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and profitable, to aduiſe, giue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and conſider of the Cenſures, and of that which is requiſite and neceſſarie, for
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:25134:140"/>
the guiding and gouernment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Therefore of this companie is it that we ſpeake, to which we ſay appertaineth the ſpirituall gouernement of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. And indeede it appeareth, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church was gouerned and guided after this manner, by the Apoſtles, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Elders, who altogether aſſembled and met together, ſo often, as there was neede of ſuch an aſſemblie to be had.<note place="margin">Act. 15.2.</note> For it is ſaide in the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that the Church of Antioch, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to haue aduiſe and iudgement, in a difficult and hard queſtion concerning do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Act. 21.18.</note> did ſend <hi>to the Apostles and Elders of the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled and met together. Alſo that the Elders of Ieruſalem were aſſembled and met together, when Iames was, to take counſell of that which Saint Paule had to doe, touching the purging and clearing of himſelfe, from the ſlaunders, that were laid vpon him, and giuen out againſt him. And we ſee alſo whither Ieſus Chriſte ſendeth the offenders, who are ſtiffe, &amp; not yelding to a confeſſion of their fault,<note place="margin">Matt. 18.17.</note> when he ſaith: <hi>Tell it vnto the Church.</hi> For by the Church there hee meaneth no other thing, but
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:25134:140"/>
the Conſiſtorie, that is to ſay, the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and guiders of the Church, euen as Chryſoſtome hath expounded it, as wee haue before obſerued it, and put it downe in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, it is verie manifeſt and plaine, that there muſt be in the Church Auncients or ouerwatchers, appointed to this end, to watch ouer the manners of the people, and who alſo together with the Paſtors, muſt looke to the exerciſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of diſcipline, that the Church may be well guided and gouerned.</p>
               <p>The fourth head or point is,<note place="margin">Of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and cenſures of the Church.</note> touching the corrections, and cenſures of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, we haue ſaide, that in euerie Church there ought to be a Conſiſtorie, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and execute the diſcipline. Nowe we adde, that this ought to be found true, and declared ſpecially in the corrections and cenſures. Wherevpon we haue certaine conſiderations to be obſerued and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that we muſt make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene ſecret faults, and thoſe which are publike and open, that we may applie thereto meete and conuenient cenſures. I call them ſecret faults which are knowne
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:25134:141"/>
to one alone, or to verie fewe perſons. And I call them publike and open faults, which are notorious and manifeſtly knowne of euerie one, or elſe of verie many men. If then the faultes be ſecrete, we muſt follow in the correction and amendment thereof, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule which is preſcribed by Ieſus Chriſt, in Matth. 18.<note place="margin">Matt. 18.15.</note> where it is ſaide, <hi>If thy brother offend or ſinne againſt thee, goe tell him therof betweene thee and him alone, &amp;c.</hi> But if the faults be publike and open, we muſt folow the commandement and example of Saint Paul.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.20.</note> His commaundement is this: <hi>Such as offend, reproue openly, that the rest alſo may feare.</hi> His example is, in that when S. Peter had committed an offenſiue fault, he did not warne him thereof apart,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> or by him ſelfe, but did reproue him openly, and that before the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſideration is, that among open faultes and offences, there are ſome which are leſſe than other ſome are, and therefore diſcretion and iudgement ought to be vſed in the cenſuring thereof. But all the circumſtances cannot be eaſily expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, wherefore the Conſiſtorie ought to be wiſe, and of good iudgement, to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the admonition and warning of S. Iude<note place="margin">de 22. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:25134:141"/>
when he ſaith: <hi>Haue compaſſion of ſome in putting difference: and other ſome which feare, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> For amongeſt faults, ſome deſerue, but ſimple or bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition alone: otherſome ſuſpention fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holie ſupper, others excommunication, and other, ſome other cenſure. But we can not be deceiued in this what ſo euer it be, in following &amp; doing that which the word of God commaundeth vs, that is to ſay, to cut off from the Church rebellious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſons, alſo faultie perſons,<note place="margin">Matt 18.17. 1. Cor. 5.3.4 Tit. 3.10.</note> which ſtand ſtiffe in their faultes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heretikes.</p>
               <p>The thirde conſideration is: that when the queſtion is of cenſures, and namely of cutting off from the vſe of the ſupper, or of excommunication, one alone ſhould not take vpon him the knowledge thereof, but it is neceſſarie and meete, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church ſhould be interpoſed or come betweene. For one man alone, what ſo euer graces he hath receiued from God, cannot, or ought not to attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſelfe ſuch an authoritie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Paul being willing to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the inceſtuous perſon, ſaith thus:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.3.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, haue
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:25134:142"/>
determined alreadie, as though I were preſent, that he that hath thus done this thing, when ye are gathered together and my ſpirite, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ſuch a one I ſay, by the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, be deliuered vnto Sathan &amp;c.</hi> Although hee was an Apoſtle, yet he alone and of his owne authoritie, doth not cut off from the Church this inceſtuous perſon, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his aduice &amp; order, to &amp; with the Church, to the ende that the matter might be done, by common authoritie &amp; conſent.</p>
               <p>And indeed in old time this was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; vſual maner, to wit, that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſures, ſhould be executed, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Conſiſtorie. For as it appeareth by the Apologetike,<note place="margin">Tertul. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologeti. cap. 39.</note> or defenſiue writing of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, if queſtion ſhoulde bee had, touching them that ought to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, or of them that had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certaine faultes, whether they ought to be receiued or no, this authoritie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the Miniſters and Elders of the Church, who ordinarily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſſembled and met together, for that purpoſe and matter.

or publiſhing of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or the caſting of one out, or the publike receiuing of him againe before the Church, was done by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, that thoſe which be of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life and conuerſation, may not haue any place amongeſt true Chriſtians to the contempt of Gods name.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that good people may not be corrupted by the conuerſation of the wicked,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.6.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The third is, that they which haue fallen and offended, may be confounded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed in them ſelues, and afterwardes lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp againe, comforted, and reconciled to the Church.<note place="margin">2.

               <p>The fift conſideration is, that men in the reprehenſions and cenſures of the Church, looke well to this, that they haue not ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, regard, or reſpect, to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance and ſhewe of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they tread the little ones, or poore people vnder their feete, and ſupport, aide, and hearten the great and rich:<note place="margin">Deut. 10.17.

               <p>But the Emperor Theodoſius was better

               <p>Certainly this is not in vaine, that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paſtors of his church: <hi>What ſo euer ye ſhall bind or looſe in earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 18.18.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be bound or looſed in heauen.</hi> For thereby he hath authoriſed his Church, in the vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keyes, by the word of God, to condemne the peruerſe, ſtubborne and vngodlie, and by the ſame word, to reconcile, and receiue to mercie, all true penitent ſinners.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:25134:145"/>
vpon Lordes and Magiſtrates. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it followeth, that none can diſtract or withdrawe himſelfe therefrom, but hee renounceth and forſaketh the meane of his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is this: that ſeeing God hath ordeined correction and diſcipline, to the end that wee ſhould profite &amp; grow vp in his doctrine, &amp; that we ſhoulde not be hardned in our ſins, but rather that they might be reproued, to the end they might not ingender and worke in vs an vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rottenneſſe or infection, It followeth that they which flie and refuſe the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and cenſures of the Church, which are made and giuen them in the name of God, refuſe God himſelfe, &amp; deſpiſe their owne ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Beholde, this is that, which wee haue heere to note and marke, as touching the diſcipline of the Churche. For concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the lawes which ſhee may eſtabliſhe and ſet vp, according to the authoritie, giuen her of GOD, wee will ſpeake thereof in the Chapter following.</p>

                  <hi>The fifteene Chapter.</hi> Whether it belong to the Church to make lawes? and if ſhe make ſome, how farre the faithfull ought to obey her.</head>
               <p>WHen the queſtion is of the lawes of the Church, wee knowe that ſom concerne the doctrine, vnder which wee comprehende the Sacramentes alſo, and other the diſcipline or pollicie, and order, that is to ſay, the faſhion and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing. The lawes which concerne doctrine, touch the conſcience, and in the knowledge and practiſe of them, ſtandeth the ſeruice &amp; worſhip of God, &amp; our own ſaluation. Of this ſort are al the points &amp; articles of doctrine, conteined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, which we muſt beleeue and obſerue, without adding any thing thereto, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing therfrom in changing it. Thoſe which concerne the diſcipline, are to bee referred to the order and honeſtie, which ought to be kept in the church, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in a maner &amp; faſhion of doing, altogether outward, and theſe may a man call indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which a man may vſe either well or euill, of this ſort are ordinances tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:25134:146"/>
the places, the times, the ſeaſons, &amp; the houres, ſet for preachings &amp; miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, the celebration of marriages, faſts, publik praiers, &amp; ſuch like things: yet notwithſtanding this muſt be knowne, that no man may appoint in the practiſe and perfourmance of theſe matters, the ſeruice of God, or our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither muſt any man thinke, that of themſelues they concerne the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Nowe the difference and diſputation that ſome moue and make in the Church touching this matter, is not as concerning this laſte kinde of Lawes, appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning only to the diſcipline or pollicie. So euery one knoweth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth, that the church cannot want her pollicie &amp; order and that, to the end ſhee may abide vnited and tyed together, ſhee hath neede of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain outward bonds: wherfore the church may without any difficulti or doubt, make lawes apperteining only to the outwarde diſcipline, and take them away, or change them, according as ſhe ſhal iudge them to be expedient &amp; profitable, hauing alwaies ſpeciall reſpect to the times, places, and perſons. As for example, the church may
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:25134:147"/>
ordeine &amp; appoint ſome day of the week for publike praiers, whether the prayers be ordinary or extraordinary: the Churche alſo may choſe a certaine day, or a certaine houre, to giue thankes vnto God when it ſhall haue pleaſed him, to haue deliuered out of ſome greate daunger either the whole Churche, or the Countrie, or the Magiſtrate, or ſome other members pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in authoritie: the Churche alſo may publiſh a faſt, ſo often as neceſſitie and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require. It may take order al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that Baptiſme be miniſtred at a certaine time after the preachings: that the holy Supper be celebrated and miniſtred ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a yeere, and at thoſe ſeaſons, which they ſhall iudge expedient and meete: that the askings or publiſhing of the banes of marriage, ſhoulde bee as it were proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or declared three ſeuerall Sundaies: And laſtly that the ſaide marriages ſhould bee celebrated at the Sermons or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, either in the morning or eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that the conſiſtories for the maners of the people, and the aſſemblie or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which haue care for the poore, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and meete together ſo often in a moneth, as ſhall bee found expedient, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:25134:147"/>
profitable.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Churche may eſtabliſh theſe lawes, and other ſuch like, which the faithful ought to obey, to the ende that there may not be any diſorder, or any con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſion among the people of God.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion is of lawes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doctrine, and the Sacraments, or els other lawes touching the diſcipline, by which they woulde binde conſciences, &amp; incloſe and comprehende therein ſimplie the ſeruice of God, that is to ſay, whether it belong to the Churche to make Lawes thereof or no? The Romiſh Catholikes, ſay they may, and wee affirme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and theſe are their reaſons follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this: The Church hath authoritie to teach: wherefore ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo authoritie to make lawes, belonging to the doctrine or teaching.</p>
               <p>But this argument may be ouerthrown in two wordes, if we denie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence For theſe be matters very much differing, to wit, to haue authoritie to teache, and to haue authoritie to make Lawes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the doctrine. Ieſus Chriſte hath in deede giuen the firſt of theſe to his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:25134:148"/>
church: but ſo hee hath not the ſeconde. And as God hath expreſſely forbidden, to add any thing vnto his law,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2. <hi>12.32.</hi>
                  </note> ſo Ieſus Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his diſciples, to teach only the doctrine which they had heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon. The church hath the vſe of the keies, &amp; can bind and looſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. Wherfore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that ſhee hath alſo authorie to eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bliſhe lawes apperteining to the doctrine.</p>
               <p>I anſwere in one worde, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is falſe as it was in the argument laſt before going: for a Lorde or Ruler will in deed giue power and authoritie to his offi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cers to abſolue &amp; to condemne according to the lawes &amp; ordinances, but yet it will not folow for al that, that he giueth them power, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to make new lawes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his people, &amp; to iudge by them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own fantaſie. So Ieſus Chriſt hath in deed giuen vnto his apoſtles &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples, this power, to binde, &amp; to looſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his lawes, but this is ill conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſay that therefore he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this power &amp; this authoritie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to make lawes, &amp; to eſtabliſhe them in his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:25134:148"/>
Church, and thereby to binde mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes ſeat: all therefore whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue &amp; do:</hi>

               <p>I anſwere, that when wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to obey our Paſtors, this ought to be vnderſtood, ſo farre foorth as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements proceede and come out of Moſes chai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re, that is to ſay, out of the word of God. For otherwiſe the Lord proteſteth and openly witneſſeth, that hee is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped in vain, when men ſet out, and preach for doctrine, the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of men.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9.</note> And he himſelf doth ſtraightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand vs earneſtly to take heed &amp; beware of the lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen of the Phariſes &amp; Saduces. Touching which matter,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>16.6</hi> August. in Iohn. Tracta. <hi>46.</hi> Cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> let vs heare Sainte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine. <hi>The Scribes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and the Phariſees ſitte in Moſes ſeate, doe that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they ſhall ſhew vnto you. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:25134:149"/>
ſet in the chaire or ſeate of Moſes, they teach the law of God, and ſo God teacheth by them.</hi> But if they would teach any thing of their owne, heare them not, and doe not that which they will ſay: for they ſeek their owne profite and gaine, and not Chriſtes profite. In ſumme then, if the Churche make &amp; ordeine for vs commaundements drawen and taken from the word of god, it is our duetie to receiue them, and to yeelde our ſelues obedient thereto: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. For it is not the Churches du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to goe beyond the boundes of Gods worde, in making lawes of her owne head and authoritie, &amp; inuenting new faſhions and maners to ſerue God by. And the rule of our obedience ought alwaies to be the very ſelfe ſame worde of God: as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius ſaide vnto Saint Peter.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon, wee muſt obey the voice of the Churche,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.

But the lawes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the church, are the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches voice, wherefore it followeth that we muſt obey the lawes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:25134:149"/>I aunſwere, as aboue is aunſwered, that wee muſt obeye the voyce of the Church, when it commeth out of Moyſes chaire and ſeate: that is to ſay, when her commaundementes ſhalbe taken and ſet from the word of God: and when alſo the queſtion ſhall bee of thinges indifferent, which ſhee ſhall ordeine and eſtabliſh, to keepe good order, &amp; to ſerue for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the maintenance and vpholding of the diſcipline: For in the things which are contrarie to Gods worde, and in thoſe alſo which of them ſelues are indifferent, but yet become and made euill thorowe ſuperſtition, to wit, becauſe that in them, they would place the ſeruice of God, and that they would think by them, to deſerue Gods grace, and the forgiuenes of ſinnes, in theſe thinges I ſay, we ought not at any hand to obey,<note place="margin">Acts. 4.19.<hi>5.29.</hi>

                  </note> As in Eſter it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, that beſides the feaſtes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the lawe, they ſhould celebrate eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yeare the feaſt of lottes, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Purim:</hi>

               <p>I anſwere, that there is no likeneſſe at all, betweene the feaſtes of <hi>Purim,</hi> or lots, and of the dedication, and theſe of ſaint Peter, ſaint Anthonie, and ſuch others. I deny not, but that thoſe two firſt, were in former time eſtabliſhed by the church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the feaſtes ordeined in the lawe: but let vs marke I pray you, howe, and to what ende. Certeinly this was for the glorie of God, &amp; to bring to their remembrance his great benefices, towardes his church, that they alſo might giue him thanks ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore. For in Eſter it is ſaide, that the feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> or lottes, was ordeined by the church, for remembraunce of this, that the people was deliuered from the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſpiracie of Haman. And Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Machabeus, with the conſent of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:25134:150"/>
whole church ordeined, the feaſt of the dedication, otherwiſe called <hi>Encaenia,</hi> in remembraunce of the deliueraunce of the people, and of the repairing, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing againe, as it were, of the Temple, which had beene polluted by Antiochus. And wee deny not but that Synodes, may ordein certain dayes, and ſolemnely keepe them, to the end that the people may ceaſe from their own workes, to faſt, to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to yeeld him thankes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as things ſhall fall out, &amp; occaſion be miniſtred, ſo that it be don without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, idolatrie, or euill example. But how can we, by the examples of the two feaſtes aforeſaide, approue or allowe the feaſtes of the Papacie or Popedome? Firſt they were but two onely. But in the Popedom, there is an infinit number. For what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure did they euer keepe in the number thereof? Secondly, the two aboue ſpoken of, were inſtituted to the name of God, and at no hande to the name of any dead Saints. But theſe are ordeined to the name of creatures, and not to the name of God, as we heare, they cal them, the feaſtes of S. Anthony, of S. Frauncis, of Saint Vincent, of Saint Sebaſtian, of Saint Agathon,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:25134:151"/>
of the virgine Mary, and ſo of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thoſe had their foundation and beginning for the ſeruice of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſerued to edification, for they were eſtabliſhed and appointed (as hath beene ſaid) to thank God, &amp; to giue him praiſe, for the benefites which hee had beſtowed vpon his Church. Theſe had no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or beginning, but in ſuperſtition and idolatrie, &amp; ſerue to no other purpoſe or matter, either more or leſſe, than the feaſtes and holie dayes of the Paganes and Ethnickes. For wherfore is it, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes giue the names of Saintes to their feaſtiuall dayes, but becauſe they meane, to ſanctifie the ſaide feaſtes, in the honour of thoſe Saintes (as they call them) whoſe name they beare? And in ſo doing, do they not ſet vp the Saintes in Gods place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſerue &amp; giue that honour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which apperteineth to him alone, as in olde time the Paganes did in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of their feaſtes and diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices?</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principall reaſons vpon which the Romiſhe Catholikes grounde them ſelues, thereby to proue, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Church, to make lawes to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:25134:151"/>
tye mens conſciences withall. Nowe it remaineth, that wee ſhewe and ſet downe our reaſons, to proue the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: It is written in Iſaiah:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 33.22</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord is our Iudge: the Lord is our lawe giuer: the Lord is our King.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 4.<hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> And in Saint Iames. <hi>There is one lawe giuer which is able to ſaue and deſtroy:</hi> whereby it is verie clearely ſeene, that it belongeth to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to make Eccleſiaſticall lawes, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: There is none but God alone, that can inſtitute and ordeine a lawfull ſeruice, which may be agreeable to himſelfe, and acceptable in his ſight, for this cauſe he him ſelfe ſaieth:<note place="margin">Deut. 12.<hi>8.</hi>32.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee ſhall not doe after all theſe thinges, that yee doe heere this day: that is, euery man whatſoeuer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good in his owne eyes: but whatſoeuer I commaund you, take heed yee do it: thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</hi> And in Ieremiah.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.22.<hi>23</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I ſpake not (ſaieth he) vnto your fathers, nor commaunded them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and ſacrifices: but this thing I commanded them, ſaying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and yee ſhal be my people, and walke yee in all the wayes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:25134:152"/>
which I haue commaunded you, that it may be well vnto you.</hi> He ſaieth alſo by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Samuell:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Sam.</hi> 15.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Thinkeſt thou, that the Lord hath as great pleaſure in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as when his voice is obeyed? Behold to obey, is better than ſacrifice: and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is better then the fatte of Rammes.</hi> Wee may read, many ſuch or the lyke ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, but ſpecially this is notable and excellent, that the ſonnes of Aaron were horribly burned and conſumed with the fire which was ſent out from the Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe they offered ſtraunge fire, and which in deede, was not commaunded them. But wee adde, that the lawes which concerne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and by which mens conſciences are tied, apperteine to the ſeruice of God. And therfore it foloweth, that there is none but God alone which can make and eſtabliſh ſuch lawes.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: Lawes concerning doctrine, and ſuch as binde mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ought to bee vnto vs a teſtimony &amp; pledge, of the wil of God: But God alone by his word can giue vnto vs this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and at no hand or by no meanes, men, as of them ſelues,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 40.13 <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 11.34.</note> 
                  <hi>For who hath inſtructed the ſpirite of the Lord? or was his Counſellor, or taught him? as the ſcripture ſaith:</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:25134:152"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that God alone, may make &amp; eſtabliſh lawes concerning doctrine, and which ſhal ſerue to binde mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: If it belong to the Church, to make lawes concerning doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, &amp; the ſeruice of god, this muſt needs be, that ſhe hath receiued the prerogatiue and authoritie, from God him ſelf, for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue not here in their life, any power ſo to doe. But ſo it is, that the Church hath not receiued from God this prerogatiue &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, God hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; plainly forbidden them, to ioyne or adde any thing to his lawe.<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>4.2.</hi>12.32.</note> Wherefore it followeth, that it doeth not apperteine to her, to make lawes touching doctrine and the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>The fift reaſon. It is neceſſary, that they which make lawes ſhoulde haue Lordſhip, rule &amp; authoritie ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom they giue thoſe lawes. But the church hath no Lordſhip, or rule, ouer the conſciences of the faithful:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.</note> for S. Peter ſpeketh with a loud voice &amp; plainly, <hi>That the Paſtors &amp; Biſhops haue not any Lordſhippe ouer the Lordes inheritance, that is to ſay, ouer the faithful, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church is compoſed &amp; made.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Cor. 1.4.</note> And S. Paul plainly proteſteth: touching himſelf, that hee hath not any dominion ouer the faith of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:25134:153"/>Wherefore it followeth, that the Church may not make or eſtabliſh lawes, to binde the conſciences of faithfull people.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.</note>The ſixt reaſon: The Lorde ſaieth: <hi>In vaine they worſhip mee, teaching for doctrine mens precepts and commaundements:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> And S. Paul calleth lawes &amp; traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, touching forbidding of marriage, and vſe of meats, <hi>the doctrine of Deuils.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2.16.18.</note> Alſo he ſaieth: <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, &amp;c. Let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his pleaſure beare rule ouer you, by humblenes of minde, and worſhipping of Angels.</hi> By theſe ſentences, it is moſt plaine and euident, that the Church ought not, nor may not eſtabliſh any ſuch lawes, to binde, tye, or reſtraine mens conſciences.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth reaſon. The lawes which take away from vs, that Chriſtian libertie which Chriſt hath gotten and purchaſed for vs, ought not in any caſe to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed or tollerated. For S. Paule exhorteth vs,<note place="margin">Galat. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſtande faſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free, and that we ſhould not be intangled againe with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> But the lawes giuen by men &amp; not from God him ſelfe, touching matters, which are commended vnto vs, with an
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:25134:153"/>
opinion of neceſſitie, &amp; which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, as workes meritorious, or as the ſeruice of God, take away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie and freedome which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs: of this ſort are the lawes made, touching the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and keeping of lent, celebration or keping ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of certaine feaſts, not to eate fleſh, vpon Friday, Saturday, and certain other dayes: &amp; ſuch like things. Wherfore it followeth, that ſuch lawes ought not in any caſe to be eſtabliſhed, ſet vp, tollerated, or borne withall.</p>
               <p>But wee wil make or put an end to this Chapiter, with two ſentences which make altogether for vs,<note place="margin">Tho. Aquin. in ſumma. part. <hi>3.</hi> in additio. <hi>46.</hi> Artic. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> &amp; are altogether againſt the Romiſh Catholikes. The one is Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of Aquine his owne, ſaying thus. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the church is founded alreadie and grounded in the faith &amp; in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it doth not belong to the Miniſters of the Church, to make newe Articles of faith, or new Sacraments, or to take away thoſe which are alreadie made and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For this is the excellencie and power, which belongeth onely vnto Ieſus Chriſt, who is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is of <hi>Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſus de Caſtro</hi> his own

                  </note> It may not at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hand bee either done or ſuffered, that the church ſhould eſtabliſh a new article of faith: but that which was in former time the true faith, and which notwithſtanding was hidden from vs, the Church bringeth to paſſe by her teſtimony and witnes, that the ſame is made knowne vnto vs, And the Abbot, is verie much deceiued in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, expounding the Chapiter, which beginneth <hi>Cum Chriſtus,</hi> that is, when Chriſt &amp;c. in the title of Heretikes, when he ſaieth, That the pope may make newe articles of faith. Hee knew not, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not what it was which hee ſpake, and therefore erred and was deceiued, as a Shoomaker ſhould be, if hee would take vpon him ſome matter ouer and beſides his occupation.</p>

And it appeareth by the hiſtorie of the Actes, and the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, howe the churches were toſſed and perſecuted, in <hi>Aſia, Antiochia, Piſidia, Iconium, Lyſtra, Galatia, Epheſus, Macedonia, Philippi, Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonia, Corinthus, Berrhoe, Rome,</hi> and many other places, but all theſe perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were as yet particular, and but in ſome one place or other, God modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>The firſt perſecution was vnder Nero, the ſixt Emperour, who was called <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Domitius Nero.</hi> He was ordeined Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in the yeere 57. after the birth of Chriſte, and reigned xiiii yeeres, ſeuen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, and certaine dayes.

And ſo the fire continued in the Citie ſixe daies ſpace, which made ſuch a deſtruction, that he became hereby very odious among the people. And ſeeing that hee could not put out this hatred, and waiting of him to doe him ſom miſchiefe for al the good turnes which he could do to the people, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out this deuiſe to ſow abrode this bruite, rumor and report, that it was the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had ben the blowers of that fire, and the authours of that deſtruction, and from that time forward, he began to perſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute them, and to put them to death, both becauſe they were (as he ſaid) the blowers of that fire, and alſo becauſe they were eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all mankinde, by reaſon of that confeſſion which they made of the name of Chriſt. And to make them to die,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:25134:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his vpholders put vpon their backes the ſkinnes of wild beaſts, that they might be torn and rent (if it were poſſible) in peeces with dogs, where alſo they crucified them &amp; burned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al aliue: &amp; although the day failed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet they burned them, that they might therby giue light to the night. This firſt perſecution began about the yeere of Chriſt 66. the x. yeere of <hi>Nero</hi> his raigne &amp; laſted 4. yeres &amp; ſomwhat more, vntill the death of that tyrant.

               <p>The 2. perſecution was vnder <hi>Domitian</hi> the xii. Emperour who was appointed Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror, in the yeere of Chriſt 83. &amp; reigned xv. yeeres, and vi. monethes. He was ſo lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp in crueltie and pride that he would haue his ſubiects call him God &amp; Lord, &amp; cauſed images of his owne perſon to bee made of gold &amp; ſiluer. He ordeined (as his father <hi>

               <p>The third perſecution, was in the dayes of <hi>Traian,</hi> the fourteenth Emperour, who was appointed Emperor about the yeere of Chriſte 100. who gouerned the Empire nienteene yeeres, ſixe monethes, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes.

in him: inſomuch that diuers Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers recorde, that hee was not ſo much of his owne nature inclined to ſhed blood, as deceiued and ſtirred vp thereto, by his councellers, and principally by the Pagane Prieſtes,<note place="margin">Freculph. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>20.</hi>

Some adde, that the number of Chriſtians, was very much increaſed, whereupon many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might come to the Romane Empire, if the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger were not preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: which alſo was a cauſe that <hi>Traian</hi> was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and kindled againſt them, as alſo <hi>Sabellicus</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Sabellicus.</note> that the great number of chriſtians were more ſuſpected of this Emperour, then the religion.

               <p>And touching the ſortes and maners of torments, we may gather it out of that which Euſebius hath written of it:<note place="margin">Euſebius.</note> that ſome were buffetted and beaten: other ſome beheaded, others burned: others had boyling pitch powred, ouer all the members of their bodies, and ſo they were by litle and litle burned and put to death: and beſides all this, that all their goods were pilled away, robbed, and confiſcate.</p>
               <p>The ſixt perſecution, was vnder Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Maximianus, the xxvi. Emperour, who ſucceeded Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, in the yeare of Chriſt, 237. &amp; reigned onely about three yeares. Hee was a ſheepeheard in his young age, but becauſe hee was a great and mightie man, beeing a Souldier, hee was created Emperour without any authoritie of the Senate, but by the onely good will and pleaſure of the Souldiers &amp; warlike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Hee beeing cruell, barbarous, and rude, mooued great perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, but namely and chieflly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctours, teachers, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:25134:166"/>
of the Churches, ſuppoſing, that when theſe men, who were (as it were) the pillers of Chriſtian religion, ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, the people would thereby bee eaſilie turned away. Euſebius ſaieth,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>6.</hi> Cap. 28.</note> that this Emperour was not kindled and ſet on fire, to execute this crueltie: but onely for hatred which hee beare, to Alexanders ſtocke and houſe, wherein there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians: But he had not any great leaſure or time to exerciſe his crueltie: for before he had reigned three whole yeares, he was ſlaine of his ſouldiers, and with him his ſonne, who was nineteene yeares olde, and their bodies were caſt into the Riuer.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth perſecution, was vnder the Emperour Decius, about the yeare of Chriſt, 247. Euſebius reciteth,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 6. Cap. <hi>39.</hi>

               <p>The eight perſecution, was vnder Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincius Valerian, and Galien his ſonne, who were created Emperours, about the yeare of Chriſt, 255. and reigned fifteene yeares: Galien reigned together with his father, fiue or ſixe yeares, and the reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>7.</hi> Cap. <hi>10.</hi>

               <p>As touching the names of torments, the Hiſtoriographers doe rehearſe them to bee diuers ſortes: they recken the whippe, wilde beaſtes, fire, the ſword, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and renting a ſunder of bodies, long keeping them in dark priſons, where they made the Martyrs to wither and drie away with griefes and pininges: forbidding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to go to viſit them, laying to them fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; burning rods of iron to burn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>The ninth perſecution, was vnder Aurelian, who was created Emperour, in the yeare of Chriſt. 273. and reigned ſixe yeares.<note place="margin">Vincentius in ſpeculo.</note> Vincentius in his Mirrour or Glaſſe, layeth out and rehearſeth at large, a great many of the faithfull, which hee ſayeth, ſuffered Martyrdome vnder this Emperour, and addeth, that hee cauſed them to bee diligently ſought out in diuers places, &amp; at the laſt put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Italie:</hi> But by the writinges of other Authours woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie credite, it appeareth, that Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an did nothing els, but think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before hande, and deuiſe this perſecution, and did not execute it.

a great company of ſouldiers to the ſaide Temple, to put in execution the Emperors commandement, a pore woman, holding a little child of hers by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, made haſt to goe to martyrdome with her brethren, and with the haſte which ſhee made, ſhee brake the ranckes and rowes of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.

               <p>Now this point or matter conteineth three arguments and reaſons to comfort vs in the middeſt of our croſſes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The firſt is, that we are not in or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of fortune, or of men, but of God. The ſecond, that God doth iuſtly and for good cauſes afflict vs: for as he is faithfull and righteous in all his workes: ſo he doeth not ſend or lay vpon vs any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,<note place="margin">

The 3. that ſeeing the affliction we ſuffer commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god our father, it ſhall not ouerwhelme or ouerthrow vs, but ſhal turne to our great good, ioy, &amp; ſaluation. Now if the croſſe fall not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo long as this life laſteth god himſelf minding &amp; willing to haue it ſo, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that which is ſaid of Lazarus &amp; the wicked rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in S.

Now ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted &amp; thou art tormented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond point is, wherefore god doth rather aflict his church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other people, as S. Peter ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Pet.</hi> 4.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The time is come that iugde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt begin at the houſe of god.</hi> And ther are 5. principall reaſons or cauſes heereof.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:25134:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The firſt, becauſe that by affliction, God declareth vnto vs, that hee loueth vs, as he ſpeaketh thereof in the Prouerbes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11.12 <hi>Heb. 12.</hi>5.6.</note> and in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth God by this meanes too diſcerne vs that are his children from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and hypocrites, as the authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrwes declareth the ſame in the xii.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.8. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 11.19</note> Chapter: and for this cauſe alſo Saint Paul ſaide vnto the Corinthians: <hi>There muſt be hereſies euen among you, that they which are approued among you might he knowne:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>are leſſe excuſeable, yea ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſerueth too ſet out the iuſtice of God, to the end we ſhould not thinke that God winketh at the ſinnes of his people.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe it ſerueth alſo, to giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of inſtruction to the wicked: for as Ieſus Chriſte ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.31.</note> 
                  <hi>If they doe theſe thinges to a greene tree, what ſhalbe done to the drie?</hi> And Saint Peter:<note place="margin">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:25134:177"/>
if the righteous ſcarcely bee ſaued, where ſhall the vngodly and the ſinner appeare?</p>
               <p>The thirde point, that the afflictions of the Churche and faithfull people, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moderated &amp; kept in good meaſure by the hand of God himſelf: For hee hath promiſed, that although he chaſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yet he wil not deſtroy them for al that.

               <p>The fourth point, wherefore God doth not ſend ſuccour &amp; aide to his Church, ſo ſoone as it is afflicted.

Wherfore let vs not looſe our courage &amp; ſtomack, in the midſt of the greateſt perſecutions and afflictions, which can come. For when all the meanes of help and aide on mens ſide, or in reſpect of them, doe faile vs, &amp; that it ſeemeth that all were done with vs, and that the church ſhold be altogether worn out, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed &amp; beaten downe, euen then wil god performe his own work, he alone ſuccouring vs, to the end, that vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone alſo, the glory of our deliuerance may be wholy and abſolutely referred.</p>
               <p>The ſixt pointe, that God through his
